You get the freedom to run your real estate business your way, without sharing your hard-earned profits.
Maximize Your Earnings
At the core of Plan 1 is the opportunity to keep every dollar you earn. With 100% commission on all transactions, you won't have to worry about splitting your commission with the brokerage or dealing with hidden fees. You get to focus on what you do best—closing deals—while keeping your entire commission in your pocket.
Additional Services to Enhance Your Success
While Plan 1 is streamlined to offer you the maximum financial benefit, we also recognize that having access to the right tools can take your business to the next level. That’s why we offer a range of additional services that you can choose from, each designed to enhance your real estate practice. These services are not included in the plan but are available to you at competitive rates whenever you need them.
	•	Errors and Omissions Insurance (E&O): E&O insurance is highly recommended for all real estate agents to safeguard against potential legal claims that may arise from your transactions. This essential protection helps cover legal expenses in case of a dispute. Though it is not included in Plan 1, you have the option to add it for an additional cost.
	•	Professional Transaction Management System: If you're looking for an efficient way to keep track of all your deals, our paperless transaction management system is available. It helps you stay organized, streamlines your workflow, and allows you to manage your transactions seamlessly. This system is an optional add-on and is not part of the base plan.
	•	Custom Marketing Materials: Want to market yourself more effectively? We offer personalized business cards, brochures, yard signs, and more to help you stand out from the competition. Each item is tailored to your branding needs and can be purchased separately, providing you with a cost-effective way to boost your visibility.
	•	Agent Website: A professional, customized website can be a game-changer in building your online presence and showcasing your listings. Our team can create a sleek, user-friendly website for you at an additional fee. This optional service is perfect for agents who want to elevate their digital footprint.
	•	Property Websites and Virtual Tours: Enhance your listings by opting for individual property websites and virtual tours, allowing potential buyers to experience properties in a more immersive way. These marketing tools can significantly boost interest in your listings but are not part of the basic plan. You can add them at your discretion.
Flexibility Without Compromise
Plan 1 gives you the ultimate flexibility by allowing you to choose only the services you need, without locking you into any extras. Nothing in the plan is complimentary or included; every additional service comes at a cost, ensuring that you have full control over what you spend and how you invest in your business. You are free to enhance your business with the tools and resources that work for you.

What is Halal Funding?
Halal Funding refers to financial products and services that comply with Islamic law, which prohibits interest-based transactions (Riba) and requires investments to be made in ethical and permissible (Halal) ventures. In real estate, this often means structuring transactions in a way that avoids traditional interest-bearing loans.

	•	Residential
Residential

At One Drive Realty, we recognize that purchasing a residential property is one of the most significant decisions in your life. Whether you're a first-time homebuyer or looking to expand your real estate investments, we are committed to offering a wide array of residential properties that cater to your needs while strictly adhering to Islamic finance principles. We understand the importance of finding a home that not only meets your lifestyle requirements but also aligns with your religious values. That's why our Halal funding options provide a Shariah-compliant, interest-free solution, ensuring your investment remains ethical and in harmony with Islamic law.
Shariah-Compliant Residential Financing Solutions
Our Halal funding approach is designed to give Muslim buyers the confidence to invest in real estate without compromising their beliefs. We collaborate with financial institutions that specialize in Halal-compliant products to provide financing options that follow Islamic guidelines. Unlike conventional loans, our Halal funding solutions eliminate interest (riba) and other practices that conflict with Shariah law.
Tailored Islamic Financing Options
We provide a variety of Halal funding structures to match your financial needs. Our solutions include:
	•	Murabaha (Cost-Plus Financing): 
In this model, the property is purchased by the financial institution and sold to you at a pre-agreed profit margin. Payments are made in instalments, with no interest involved, ensuring full transparency in the transaction.
	•	Ijarah (Lease-to-Own): 
This structure allows you to lease the property with the option to purchase it over time. As you make lease payments, a portion goes towards eventual ownership, all while adhering to Islamic finance principles.
Diverse Range of Residential Listings
At One Drive Realty, we take pride in offering a comprehensive selection of residential properties to fit every preference and budget. Whether you're seeking a cozy single-family home or a high-end luxury residence, our listings are carefully curated to offer you a wide range of choices.

	•	MULTIFAMILY 
Multi-family

Multi-family

Multifamily properties offer an exceptional opportunity for investors looking to generate steady rental income while building long-term wealth. At One Drive Realty, we specialize in providing Halal funding solutions for multifamily investments, ensuring that all transactions adhere to Islamic finance principles. Our goal is to help you invest in multifamily properties confidently, knowing your investment aligns with your religious and ethical values.
Sharia-Compliant Investment Solutions
We understand the importance of offering Shariah-compliant options for real estate investors. Our multifamily investment deals are structured to meet Islamic guidelines, utilizing equity partnerships or rent-based agreements such as Ijarah. In this model, rental payments contribute towards your ownership of the property, providing you with both an ethical and profitable investment strategy. We make it easy for you to invest without compromising on your beliefs.
Consistent and Stable Revenue Streams
Multifamily properties are ideal for generating a consistent and reliable source of income. With multiple tenants occupying a single building, you can earn steady rental income that can grow over time. This makes multifamily investments a great choice for those seeking a passive income that is not only financially rewarding but also Shariah-compliant. With proper property management, these investments can offer a stable, long-term revenue stream that fits perfectly within an Islamic financial framework.
Affordable and Ethical Ownership Models
At One Drive Realty, we provide a range of Halal financing options designed to make multifamily property ownership more affordable. One popular model is diminishing Musharakah, where ownership of the property is shared between you and the financial institution. Over time, as you make payments, your share of the property increases while the financial institution’s share diminishes. This structure ensures that no interest (riba) is involved, allowing you to invest ethically and gradually gain full ownership of the property.
Why Choose One Drive Realty for Multifamily Investments?
Islamic Finance Expertise: We are dedicated to offering investment opportunities that fully comply with Islamic financial principles. Our team is experienced in structuring real estate deals that allow you to grow your wealth in an ethical, Shariah-compliant way.
Comprehensive Support: From finding the right multifamily property to securing Halal financing, we provide end-to-end services that make the investment process smooth and straightforward.
Ethical, Interest-Free Financing: Our financing solutions avoid interest and other elements that conflict with Islamic law, ensuring that your investment remains both ethical and profitable.

For business owners and investors seeking to acquire commercial real estate, Halal funding presents a unique opportunity to ensure that your investment aligns with Islamic principles. This approach guarantees that your financial dealings remain free of interest (riba) and speculative elements (gharar). Whether you're interested in office spaces, retail locations, or industrial properties, One Drive Realty's extensive commercial portfolio is anchored in Shariah-compliant financial structures.

	•	Unit Share Cert.
Unit Share Cert.

At One Drive Realty, we offer an innovative approach to real estate investment through Unit Share Certificates. This method provides a flexible and accessible way for investors to gain exposure to real estate without the complexities of traditional property ownership. Unit Share Certificates represent a portion of ownership in a real estate asset or portfolio, allowing investors to benefit from property appreciation and income generation without directly managing the property.
What Are Unit Share Certificates?
Unit Share Certificates are a form of investment that allows individuals to own a share of a real estate asset. Each certificate represents a fractional ownership of a property or a group of properties, giving investors a stake in the income and value generated by those assets.
Benefits of Unit Share Certificates
	•	Accessibility: 
Unit Share Certificates lower the barrier to entry for real estate investment. Instead of needing substantial capital to purchase an entire property, investors can buy shares, making it easier to diversify their portfolio.
	•	Diversification:  
By investing in Unit Share Certificates, you can spread your investment across multiple properties, reducing risk and potentially increasing returns.
	•	Passive Income: 
Investors in Unit Share Certificates can earn passive income from rental yields or other revenue generated by the underlying properties, without the need to manage the property themselves.
	•	Liquidity: 
Unlike traditional real estate investments, which can be difficult to sell quickly, Unit Share Certificates can often be sold more easily, providing investors with greater liquidity.
	•	Professional Management: 
The properties underlying the Unit Share Certificates are typically managed by experienced real estate professionals, ensuring that they are maintained and operated efficiently.
How Unit Share Certificates Work
	•	Investment: 
Investors purchase Unit Share Certificates, which represent a portion of ownership in a real estate asset or portfolio.
	•	Income Distribution:
Investors receive a share of the income generated by the property, such as rental income, based on the number of shares they own.
	•	Appreciation: 
As the value of the underlying property increases, the value of the Unit Share Certificates may also rise, providing capital appreciation to the investor.
	•	Liquidity Options: 
Depending on the terms of the investment, investors may have the option to sell their Unit Share Certificates, providing a potential exit strategy.
Unit Share Certificates vs. Traditional Property Ownership
	•	Lower Capital Requirements: 
Unlike traditional property ownership, which requires significant upfront capital, Unit Share Certificates allow investors to participate in real estate with a smaller financial commitment.
	•	No Management Responsibilities: 
Investors do not need to worry about property management, as this is handled by professionals.
	•	Flexibility and Liquidity: 
Unit Share Certificates offer more flexibility and liquidity compared to owning physical property, making them an attractive option for many investors.
Is Unit Share Certificate Investment Right for You?
Unit Share Certificates can be an excellent choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolio, gain exposure to real estate, and generate passive income without the complexities of direct property ownership. However, like all investments, they come with risks, and it’s essential to understand the specific terms and conditions associated with the certificates you’re considering.
At One Drive Realty, we are committed to providing our investors with the information and support they need to make informed decisions. If you’re interested in exploring Unit Share Certificates as part of your investment strategy, now is the time to do it.

	•	Envelope Structures
Envelope Structures

At One Drive Realty, we recognize the importance of innovative and sustainable building practices, which is why we offer services related to envelope structures in real estate development. An envelope structure refers to the outer shell of a building, designed to protect the interior from external elements while maintaining energy efficiency and structural integrity.
What Are Envelope Structures?
The building envelope consists of all the elements of a structure that separate the interior from the exterior. This includes walls, roofs, windows, doors, and foundations. The envelope plays a crucial role in determining the energy efficiency, comfort, and durability of a building.
Key Components of Envelope Structures
	•	Walls: 
The exterior walls provide structural support and protect the interior from weather conditions. They also contribute to insulation and overall energy efficiency.
	•	Roof: 
The roof is a vital part of the envelope, shielding the building from rain, snow, and sunlight. A well-designed roof helps regulate temperature and prevent energy loss.
	•	Windows and Doors: 
Windows and doors are essential for ventilation, natural light, and access. However, they can also be points of energy loss if not properly designed and sealed.
	•	Insulation: 
Insulation within the walls, roof, and foundation helps maintain a consistent interior temperature, reducing the need for heating and cooling.
	•	Air Barriers: 
These prevent air leakage, which can significantly impact energy efficiency. Proper sealing of the envelope ensures that air does not escape, keeping the building's interior comfortable.
Benefits of High-Quality Envelope Structures
	•	Energy Efficiency: 
A well-designed building envelope reduces energy consumption by minimizing heat loss in the winter and heat gain in the summer. This leads to lower energy bills and a smaller carbon footprint.
	•	Comfort: 
Maintaining a stable indoor temperature and controlling humidity levels contributes to the comfort of the building's occupants.
	•	Durability: 
A robust envelope structure protects the building from external elements, such as moisture, wind, and temperature fluctuations, enhancing its lifespan.
	•	Sustainability: 
By improving energy efficiency and reducing the need for artificial heating and cooling, high-quality envelope structures contribute to environmental sustainability.
	•	Cost Savings: 
Over time, the energy savings from an efficient envelope can offset the initial investment, making it a cost-effective solution for property owners.
Envelope Structures and One Drive Realty

	•	1031 EXCHANGE

A 1031 exchange is a powerful tax-deferral strategy in real estate that allows investors to sell a property and reinvest the proceeds in a new, like-kind property, deferring capital gains taxes. Here’s how it works and how One Drive Realty can assist:
Types of Properties That Qualify for a 1031 Exchange:
	•	Investment and Business Properties: 
To qualify for a 1031 exchange, the properties involved must be held for investment purposes or used in a business or trade. This includes residential rental properties, commercial buildings, vacant land, and industrial properties.
	•	Like-Kind Properties: 
The properties exchanged must be of “like-kind,” meaning they must be similar in nature or character, even if they differ in grade or quality. For example, you can exchange an apartment building for a commercial office space, but not for a personal residence.
How One Drive Realty Facilitates the 1031 Exchange Process:
	•	Identification of Replacement Property: 
One Drive Realty helps clients identify suitable replacement properties that meet the criteria for a 1031 exchange. Our expertise ensures that the properties are truly “like-kind” and qualify under IRS guidelines.
	•	Coordination and Documentation: 
We work closely with qualified intermediaries, who are essential in the 1031 exchange process, to handle the funds and ensure compliance with IRS rules. One Drive Realty assists with the necessary documentation, making the process smooth and efficient.
	•	Timeline Management:
The 1031 exchange process has strict deadlines, including a 45-day window to identify a replacement property and a 180-day period to complete the exchange. One Drive Realty helps manage these timelines to ensure that clients meet all requirements.
Tax Benefits of a 1031 Exchange:
	•	Deferral of Capital Gains Taxes: 
The primary benefit of a 1031 exchange is the deferral of capital gains taxes that would otherwise be due upon the sale of an investment property. This allows investors to reinvest the full proceeds from the sale into a new property, maximizing their buying power.
	•	Wealth Accumulation: 
By deferring taxes, investors can leverage their entire investment to purchase higher-value properties or multiple properties, potentially increasing their returns and building wealth more rapidly.
	•	Portfolio Diversification: 
A 1031 exchange allows investors to diversify their real estate holdings by exchanging one type of property for another, such as moving from a residential rental property to a commercial asset, without triggering immediate tax liabilities.
At One Drive Realty, we are committed to helping our clients navigate the complexities of a 1031 exchange. By leveraging our expertise and resources, you can take full advantage of this tax-deferral strategy to grow and diversify your real estate investments.

	•	RESIDENTIAL

Residential properties are often the starting point for many real estate investors looking to capitalize on the benefits of the 1031 Exchange. This powerful tax-deferral strategy allows property owners to sell an investment property and reinvest the proceeds into another like-kind property, thereby deferring capital gains taxes and potentially enhancing their investment opportunities. At One Drive Realty, we offer extensive services tailored to residential property investors to help them maximize the advantages of the 1031 Exchange.
Key Aspects of Residential 1031 Exchanges:
	•	Deferral of Capital Gains Tax: By utilizing the 1031 Exchange, investors selling residential investment properties can defer their capital gains taxes. This means more of your investment capital remains intact, ready to be reinvested in new opportunities. Deferring taxes allows you to grow your portfolio more rapidly by leveraging the full proceeds from your sale.
	•	Like-Kind Property Investments: To qualify for a 1031 Exchange, residential properties must be exchanged for another similar investment property. This includes rental homes, vacation rentals, or any other residential property used for income generation. The like-kind requirement ensures that the investment continues to serve its income-producing purpose.
	•	Experienced Guidance: The 1031 Exchange process involves strict regulatory compliance and tight deadlines. One Drive Realty provides expert guidance to navigate these complexities, ensuring that you adhere to the 180-day timeline for closing on your replacement property and fulfill all IRS requirements. Our team’s in-depth knowledge helps streamline the process, making it efficient and stress-free.

	•	MULTIFAMILY

Multifamily properties, such as apartment complexes or duplexes, present significant opportunities for investors to take advantage of the 1031 Exchange. This tax-deferral strategy allows you to sell an existing multifamily property and reinvest the proceeds into another like-kind property, enabling you to defer capital gains taxes and maximize your investment potential. At One Drive Realty, we specialize in helping investors navigate this process to achieve their real estate goals.
Key Features of Multifamily 1031 Exchanges:

By upgrading to higher-value or better-located properties, you can significantly enhance your rental income and overall cash flow.
	•	Expanding Investment Portfolio: The 1031 Exchange provides a unique opportunity to swap smaller multifamily properties for larger complexes or those situated in more desirable markets. This strategy allows you to diversify and expand your investment portfolio, taking advantage of opportunities for greater returns and improved asset quality.

	•	VESTED EQUITY

Vested equity refers to the portion of an investment property’s value that the owner has accumulated through appreciation or mortgage payments. In the context of a 1031 Exchange, understanding and managing vested equity is crucial for maximizing the benefits of tax deferral and optimizing your investment strategy.
Key Considerations for Vested Equity in 1031 Exchanges:
	•	Reinvestment Requirements: To fully defer capital gains taxes under a 1031 Exchange, property owners must reinvest the entire value of their vested equity from the sold property into a new like-kind investment. If any portion of the vested equity is not reinvested, it will be subject to taxation. This reinvestment ensures that you maintain the full tax-deferral advantage of the exchange.
	•	Building Equity Over Time: The 1031 Exchange provides a unique opportunity for investors to roll over their vested equity into higher-value properties continuously. By doing so, you can leverage your equity to acquire more valuable assets, enhancing your wealth and investment portfolio while deferring taxes.
	•	Strategic Equity Management: At One Drive Realty, we offer expert assistance in evaluating your vested equity and strategizing its reinvestment. Our goal is to ensure that your equity is effectively utilized in acquiring new properties that not only meet IRS requirements but also offer significant growth potential and higher returns.

	•	REIT-TRADE

What It Is: 
REIT stands for Real Estate Investment Trust. A REIT-Trade involves buying and selling shares of a REIT, which is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-producing real estate. These shares are traded on major stock exchanges, similar to stocks.
Types of REITs:
	•	Equity REITs: 
Own and manage income-generating properties.

While 1031 Exchanges require reinvestment in like-kind properties, trading into REITs provides liquidity. Investors can buy and sell shares as needed, offering flexibility that direct real estate investments do not.
	•	Regular Income Streams:
The dividends received from REIT investments can provide a consistent income stream, which can be reinvested or used for other financial goals, while the capital gains from a 1031 Exchange remain deferred.

Navigating the Real Estate Market: A Comprehensive Guide for Buyers and Sellers
The real estate market is a dynamic and ever-evolving landscape influenced by factors such as economic conditions, interest rates, housing demand, and consumer preferences. Whether you're a first-time homebuyer, a seasoned investor, or someone looking to sell your property, understanding key dynamics is essential to making informed decisions. This guide will explore the essentials of buying and selling real estate, providing practical insights and strategies to help you navigate the complexities of the market with confidence.
The Real Estate Market: An Overview
Real estate can be broadly classified into residential, commercial, multifamily, and industrial sectors. The residential market, which deals with homes, apartments, and condominiums, often receives the most attention.
Several key factors shape the real estate market:
	•	Interest Rates: Low-interest rates can stimulate housing demand by making borrowing more affordable, while high rates can slow down the market.
	•	Supply and Demand: A buyer’s market occurs when there are more homes than potential buyers, while a seller’s market happens when there are more buyers than available properties.
	•	Economic Conditions: Economic growth typically boosts consumer confidence and encourages property investment, whereas downturns often lead to market stagnation.
For Buyers: Key Considerations Before Purchasing
Buying a home is one of the most significant financial investments many will make in their lifetime. To ensure a successful transaction, consider the following:
	•	Assess Your Financial Situation Begin by determining how much you can afford based on your income, debt, and savings. It’s essential to:
	•	Get pre-approved for a mortgage: This shows sellers you’re a serious buyer and provides clarity on your budget.
	•	Save for a down payment: Conventional loans often require a 20% down payment, but programs may offer options as low as 3%.
	•	Identify Your Needs and Wants Outline what you’re looking for in a property, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities. Prioritize essential features versus desirable ones to stay focused during your search.
	•	Research the Neighborhood The location is key in real estate. Investigate neighborhoods that fit your lifestyle, considering aspects like commute times, school quality, crime rates, and property value trends.
	•	Home Inspections and Appraisals Once you’ve found a property, a home inspection can reveal potential issues, while an appraisal ensures the property’s value aligns with the purchase price.
	•	Budget for Closing Costs Aside from the down payment, you’ll need to account for closing costs, typically 2-5% of the purchase price. These include fees for appraisals, attorney services, title insurance, and more.
For Sellers: Strategies to Maximize Your Home's Value
If you're selling your home, you can take several steps to increase its value and ensure a smooth sale:
	•	Set the Right Price A competitive price is critical to attracting buyers. A real estate agent can help you conduct a comparative market analysis (CMA) to determine an accurate listing price.
	•	Stage Your Home First impressions matter. Clean, declutter, and rearrange furniture to make your home more appealing. Consider professional staging services to showcase the property’s best features.
	•	Effective Marketing A comprehensive marketing strategy is essential to reach potential buyers. Utilize professional photography, virtual tours, and list your property on high-traffic platforms like Zillow, Realtor.com, and social media.
	•	Be Flexible with Showings Being available for showings increases the chance of attracting buyers. Try to accommodate weekend and evening visits to maximize exposure.
	•	Negotiate Smartly When reviewing offers, don’t focus solely on price. Consider factors like contingencies, financing, and the buyer’s flexibility on the closing date. Work with your real estate agent to secure the best terms.
Current Trends in Real Estate
Being aware of current real estate trends can help both buyers and sellers make smarter decisions. Some of the key trends include:
	•	Virtual Tours: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual tours have become more popular, allowing buyers to view properties remotely.
	•	Sustainability: Energy-efficient homes and green building practices are on the rise, as more buyers prioritize sustainability.
	•	Suburban Shift: Many buyers are moving away from urban centers to suburban or rural areas, looking for larger properties with outdoor space, especially as remote work becomes more common.
Conclusion
The real estate market can be complex, but understanding the key factors and working with experienced professionals will enable you to make informed decisions. Buyers should assess their financial readiness, research neighborhoods, and carefully consider their priorities, while sellers should focus on pricing, staging, and marketing their properties effectively.
Whether you’re buying or selling, staying informed about current market conditions is crucial.

	•	RESIDENTIAL

Residential real estate is a cornerstone of the housing market, encompassing properties designed for personal use, such as single-family homes, townhouses, and condominiums. As a critical sector in the industry, it provides both first-time buyers and seasoned investors with opportunities to build wealth and secure homes for their families. One Drive Realty recognizes the diversity of this market and offers tailored services to meet the needs of every buyer, seller, and investor.
Key Aspects of Residential Real Estate:
Types of Residential Properties:
	•	Single-Family Homes: 
Ideal for individuals or families looking for private residences, offering autonomy and space.
	•	Multi-Family Homes:
Duplexes or triplexes that allow for owner-occupied investment opportunities, where one or more units can be rented out.
	•	Condominiums: 
Popular in urban areas, these properties are often more affordable than single-family homes and come with shared amenities.
	•	Townhouses: 
A hybrid between condos and single-family homes, townhouses offer multiple floors of living space with shared walls, commonly seen in suburban developments.
Homebuying Process:
	•	Pre-Approval for Mortgages: 
One Drive Realty guides potential buyers through mortgage pre-approval, a crucial step in determining the budget and securing financing.
	•	Home Search and Selection: 
Using advanced tools, such as virtual tours and detailed property listings, buyers can explore homes that match their criteria without the need for in-person visits.
	•	Negotiation and Purchase: From the initial offer to final negotiations, One Drive Realty ensures clients get the best deal while navigating the complexities of home purchases, including inspections, appraisals, and closing processes.

	•	COMMERCIAL

Commercial real estate is a lucrative segment that involves the buying, selling, and leasing of properties used for business purposes. These include office buildings, retail spaces, industrial properties, and multifamily complexes. The commercial market tends to be more complex than residential real estate, requiring in-depth knowledge of zoning laws, financing options, and market trends. One Drive Realty excels in helping investors and business owners navigate this intricate landscape to make informed decisions and maximize their returns.
Key Aspects of Commercial Real Estate:
Types of Commercial Properties:
	•	Office Spaces: 
From small office buildings to corporate headquarters, office real estate is a vital sector for companies seeking functional and modern workplaces.
	•	Retail Spaces: 
Shopping centers, strip malls, and stand-alone retail buildings fall under this category. One Drive Realty helps clients evaluate foot traffic, location, and rental potential to secure profitable retail investments.
	•	Industrial Properties: 
Warehouses, distribution centers, and manufacturing plants are part of the industrial real estate market. These properties have seen increased demand with the rise of e-commerce and supply chain developments.
	•	Multifamily Complexes: 
While technically residential, large apartment buildings and other multifamily complexes are treated as commercial investments due to their scale. One Drive Realty assists investors in evaluating cash flow potential and tenant management.
Commercial Real Estate Financing:
	•	Loan Options: 
Financing for commercial real estate often requires larger down payments and different terms than residential properties. One Drive Realty works with lenders to secure favorable financing, including SBA loans, commercial mortgages, and bridge loans.
	•	Investment Returns: 
Commercial real estate often provides higher returns compared to residential properties, thanks to longer leases and higher rental income. One Drive Realty helps investors calculate returns, factoring in variables such as maintenance costs, vacancy rates, and property taxes.
Commercial Property Leasing:
	•	Long-Term Leases: 
Commercial properties typically have long-term leases, often spanning five to 10 years, providing stability for property owners. One Drive Realty negotiates favorable lease terms that benefit both landlords and tenants.
	•	Triple Net Leases (NNN): 
These leases place responsibility for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance on the tenant, offering significant financial advantages to the property owner.
Market Trends and Development:
	•	Post-Pandemic Recovery: 
The commercial real estate sector has experienced shifts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in office spaces and retail. Businesses are opting for hybrid work models, and online shopping has reduced the demand for brick-and-mortar stores. One Drive Realty stays on top of these trends, identifying emerging opportunities in flexible workspaces and industrial warehouses.
	•	Sustainability in Commercial Buildings: 
Similar to residential real estate, there’s growing interest in sustainable commercial buildings. One Drive Realty connects clients with energy-efficient properties, which can reduce operational costs and appeal to environmentally conscious tenants.
Commercial Development and Zoning:
	•	Land Acquisition for Development: 
One Drive Realty assists developers in acquiring land for commercial projects, ensuring that properties meet zoning requirements and offer favorable development conditions.
	•	Mixed-Use Developments: 
These projects combine residential, retail, and office spaces into one, creating a community-like atmosphere. One Drive Realty works with investors to develop profitable mixed-use spaces, particularly in urban areas.

	•	CAP-ROR-REO

At One Drive Realty, understanding key real estate metrics is essential for making informed investment decisions. Three crucial terms in our industry are Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate), Rate of Return (ROR), and Real Estate Owned (REO). Here’s how these terms are relevant to our services and how clients can benefit from them:
Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate):
	•	What It Is: 
The Cap Rate is a vital metric used to assess the potential return on an investment property. It is calculated by dividing the property’s net operating income (NOI) by its current market value or purchase price.
	•	Relevance to One Drive Realty: 
We use Cap Rate to evaluate and compare different properties, ensuring that our clients invest in assets that offer the best return relative to their cost. Our expertise in analyzing Cap Rates allows us to identify high-potential properties that align with our clients’ financial goals.
	•	Client Benefits: 
By understanding Cap Rate, clients can quickly assess the profitability of various real estate investments. This knowledge empowers them to make strategic choices that maximize their returns.
Rate of Return (ROR):
	•	What It Is: 
The Rate of Return (ROR) measures the overall profitability of an investment over time. It reflects the percentage gain or loss relative to the initial amount invested, making it a critical factor in long-term investment planning.
	•	Relevance to One Drive Realty: 
Our team at One Drive Realty uses ROR to track the performance of investment properties. By analyzing ROR, we help clients understand how their investments are performing and guide them in optimizing their portfolios for sustained growth.
	•	Client Benefits: 
Understanding ROR enables clients to evaluate the effectiveness of their investments, adjust their strategies as needed, and set realistic expectations for future returns.
Real Estate Owned (REO):
	•	What It Is: 
Real Estate Owned (REO) refers to properties that have been repossessed by lenders, typically after foreclosure. These properties are often available at discounted prices, presenting unique opportunities for savvy investors.
	•	Relevance to One Drive Realty: 
One Drive Realty specializes in identifying and acquiring REO properties for our clients. By including these properties in our offerings, we provide clients with access to valuable investment opportunities that can enhance their portfolios.
	•	Client Benefits: 
Clients who are familiar with REO properties can take advantage of lower purchase prices and the potential for significant returns. Our team assists clients throughout the process, from identifying promising REO properties to managing the acquisition.
At One Drive Realty, we believe that an informed client is an empowered client. By understanding terms like Cap Rate, Rate of Return, and Real Estate Owned, our clients are better equipped to make decisions that lead to successful investments. We are committed to providing the knowledge, tools, and support necessary to help our clients thrive in the dynamic world of real estate.
To excel in the world of real estate CAP-ROR-REO play a vital part and One Drive Realty has the pro players of this game, do you want to take advantage? Fret not! We are just an email away. Drop us an email at info@onedriverealty.com 
	•	CAPITALIZATION RATE

At One Drive Realty, we understand that real estate investment success depends heavily on assessing returns and understanding the financial metrics that drive profitability. One of the key measures for real estate investors is the capitalization rate, commonly referred to as the Cap Rate. It's essential for evaluating income-producing properties and determining the potential return on investment.
What is Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate)?
The Cap Rate is a metric used to calculate the expected rate of return on a real estate investment property. It is expressed as a percentage and represents the ratio of the property’s Net Operating Income (NOI) to its current market value or purchase price. Essentially, the Cap Rate gives investors a clear snapshot of what the property will yield as an annual return, assuming the investment is made without debt (i.e., no mortgage).
How to Calculate Cap Rate
Cap Rate= [Net Operating Income (NOI) / Current Market Value] × 100
For example, if a property has a NOI of $50,000 and the current market value of the property is $1,000,000, the Cap Rate is calculated as follows:
Cap Rate= [50,000/1,000,000] × 100 = 5%
This means the property would generate a 5% annual return on investment.
Why Cap Rate Matters in Real Estate
	•	Evaluating Property Profitability: 
Cap Rate is a vital tool for investors to quickly assess the profitability of a real estate investment. It helps compare properties on an "apples-to-apples" basis, allowing investors to determine which investments yield the highest returns.
	•	Risk Assessment: 
Cap Rates are closely linked to the risk associated with a property. Properties with higher Cap Rates often come with greater risk but also offer higher returns, such as in emerging or less stable markets. Conversely, lower Cap Rates are associated with safer investments in more stable markets but tend to provide lower returns.
	•	Market Indicator: 
The Cap Rate reflects the overall market condition in a specific location. A high Cap Rate might indicate a buyer's market, where prices are low relative to the income generated. Conversely, a low Cap Rate often indicates a seller's market, where prices are higher and returns are lower.
Cap Rate at One Drive Realty
At One Drive Realty, we specialize in helping clients understand and utilize the Cap Rate to make informed investment decisions. Whether you are interested in residential properties, multifamily units, commercial real estate, or vacant land, the Cap Rate is crucial to ensuring that your investment aligns with your financial goals.
	•	Residential Real Estate: 
Typically, Cap Rates for residential properties tend to be lower (3-6%) in established neighborhoods with less risk, but offer steady, reliable returns over time.
	•	Multifamily Properties: 
Multifamily units often have slightly higher Cap Rates (5-8%) due to the potential for rental income from multiple tenants, making them an attractive option for investors looking for steady cash flow.
	•	Commercial Properties: 
Commercial real estate, such as office buildings, retail spaces, and industrial properties, often features higher Cap Rates (6-10%) due to the larger size of investments and greater variability in tenant leases.
	•	Vacant Land: 
While more speculative, vacant land typically offers high Cap Rates in emerging markets but comes with a higher degree of risk, as future development or demand may be uncertain.
	•	Dairy Farming & Agricultural Land: 
Cap Rates for agricultural land and farming investments vary widely depending on location and market conditions. These properties can offer steady returns through production, but market forces such as commodity prices and climate factors introduce variability.
How One Drive Realty Supports Cap Rate Analysis
	•	Expert Analysis: 
Our experienced real estate professionals provide comprehensive Cap Rate assessments, helping you make data-driven decisions about your investments.

Contact us at info@onedriverealty.com and let us help you achieve your financial goals by optimizing your real estate investments using Cap Rate analysis.
	•	RATE OF RETURN RATE

The Rate of Return (ROR) is a critical metric in real estate investments, representing the profitability of an investment over a specific period, usually calculated annually. One Drive Realty focuses on helping clients achieve favourable ROR through strategic investments in various property types, including residential, multifamily, commercial, and vacant land.
Factors Influencing ROR in Real Estate:
	•	Property Appreciation: 
As property values increase over time, the ROR rises, enhancing the profitability of the investment. One Drive Realty assists clients in identifying markets with high growth potential.
	•	Rental Income: 
For income-generating properties like residential rentals, multifamily units, or commercial spaces, consistent rental income can significantly boost the ROR.
	•	Cost Management: 
Operating expenses such as property taxes, insurance, and maintenance fees can impact the ROR. One Drive Realty advises clients on how to reduce these costs through efficient property management.
One Drive Realty helps investors monitor and improve their ROR by providing detailed analyses of market conditions, property management strategies, and potential risks. Seize this opportunity now by emailing us at info@onedriverealty.com 
	•	REAL ESTATE OWNED

Real Estate Owned (REO) properties are those that have been repossessed by lenders, typically banks, after a foreclosure. These properties can be goldmines for investors seeking discounted real estate that can be renovated and sold for profit. At One Drive Realty, we specialize in identifying lucrative REO opportunities and guiding you through the entire purchasing process.
Benefits of Investing in REO Properties
	•	Lower Purchase Prices: REO properties are often available at significantly reduced prices, allowing you to maximize your return on investment once you renovate and restore the property.
	•	Faster Transactions: Since these properties are owned by banks, the buying process tends to be more straightforward and quicker than traditional transactions, enabling you to close deals and start your investment journey without delays.
	•	Investment Potential: Our team at One Drive Realty assists you in thoroughly evaluating the condition of REO properties. We provide estimates for renovation costs and assess potential rental or resale values, ensuring you make informed investment decisions.

	•	Lower Vacancy Risks: Multifamily properties tend to offer more stability in rental income. When one unit becomes vacant, the impact on total income is minimized, thanks to multiple units generating revenue. This feature makes multifamily investments a safer choice for consistent cash flow.
	•	Long-Term Value Appreciation: Multifamily properties have a track record of appreciating over time, providing investors with excellent long-term wealth-building opportunities. One Drive Realty is dedicated to helping you analyze potential returns and effectively manage property operations, ensuring you make informed decisions.

	•	COMMERCIAL

Commercial real estate represents a lucrative opportunity for investors, featuring properties such as office buildings, retail spaces, and industrial facilities. These properties offer stable rental income through long-term leases, making them an ideal choice for those looking to diversify their portfolios and achieve substantial returns. At One Drive Realty, we specialize in identifying high-value commercial properties tailored to our clients' investment goals.
Features of Commercial Investments
	•	Long-Term Leases: Commercial tenants often enter into multi-year leases, ensuring a predictable cash flow over extended periods. This stability allows investors to plan effectively and maximize their returns.
	•	Higher ROI: With larger properties and typically higher rental rates, commercial real estate often yields greater returns compared to residential investments. This potential for increased profitability makes commercial properties an attractive option for savvy investors.
	•	Tenant Responsibility: Many commercial properties operate under triple net leases, where tenants are responsible for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance. This arrangement reduces the owner’s expenses and enhances overall profitability, providing a more streamlined investment experience.

	•	VACANT LAND

Investing in vacant land presents unique opportunities for development, whether for residential, commercial, or agricultural purposes. One Drive Realty specializes in helping investors identify prime parcels of land that can be developed now or held for future appreciation.
Advantages of Vacant Land Investments
	•	Low Holding Costs: Vacant land typically incurs minimal maintenance expenses, and property taxes are generally lower compared to developed properties. This cost-effectiveness allows investors to hold land longer without significant financial burden.
	•	Development Potential: Investors have the flexibility to develop the land themselves, creating custom projects that meet market demands, or sell it to developers for a profit. This versatility makes vacant land a valuable asset in any investment strategy.
	•	Strategic Locations: One Drive Realty assists clients in identifying land located in high-growth areas where demand for development is on the rise. Investing in these strategic locations can lead to significant appreciation and higher returns in the future.

	•	BUILD 2 SUIT PROFIT

The Build-to-Suit (BTS) model offers a strategic opportunity for investors and developers looking to maximize returns while minimizing risks. This model revolves around constructing properties specifically tailored to the needs of a tenant, typically within the commercial real estate sector. One Drive Realty provides comprehensive support for investors throughout the BTS process, ensuring projects are aligned with tenant expectations and generate optimal financial outcomes.
Benefits of the Build-to-Suit Model:
	•	Guaranteed Tenants One of the most attractive features of the Build-to-Suit model is the security it offers. In most cases, tenants are secured before construction even begins. This approach guarantees immediate occupancy once the project is completed, significantly reducing the financial risks associated with vacant properties and ensuring that you have a steady stream of income from day one.
	•	Tailored Customization In the Build-to-Suit model, every aspect of the construction is designed with the tenant's specific needs in mind. Whether it's the layout, technology integration, or specialized infrastructure, the property is customized to meet the exact requirements of the tenant. This results in long-term lease stability, as tenants are more likely to stay in a space built to their specifications.
	•	Premium Rental Rates Because the property is designed precisely to meet the needs of the tenant, investors can typically command higher rental rates compared to traditional properties. The combination of a secure tenant, custom-built space, and high demand for specialized real estate leads to increased profitability for the developer and investor.
	•	Reduced Vacancy Risks With a pre-leased, purpose-built property, the chances of facing vacancies or turnover costs are significantly lower. The tailored nature of the building also reduces the risk of tenant dissatisfaction, ensuring they are likely to extend leases or renew contracts.
	•	Long-Term Investment Stability The Build-to-Suit model offers long-term investment security. Tenants in BTS properties often sign extended leases, ensuring predictable revenue over time. This makes it easier to plan and manage finances, with the added benefit of reducing the operational risks associated with short-term leases or frequent tenant turnover.
Why Choose One Drive Realty for Your Build-to-Suit Projects?
One Drive Realty offers hands-on expertise, guiding you through each phase of the Build-to-Suit process—from initial project consultation to securing tenants and overseeing construction. With a deep understanding of commercial real estate, we help developers, investors, and property owners capitalize on this model’s advantages, while ensuring projects are completed efficiently, on time, and within budget. Invest now to furnish tomorrow. Contact us at info@onedriverealty.com and let our team guide you through the process.

License Regulators

One Drive Realty operates within the highly regulated field of real estate, and compliance with licensing regulations is fundamental to ensuring professionalism and trust in the industry. Every state and jurisdiction where One Drive Realty operates has its own set of rules and regulations, overseen by license regulators or real estate commissions. These entities ensure that real estate professionals adhere to high ethical standards, follow the law, and maintain the necessary qualifications to serve clients.
Who Are License Regulators?
License regulators, often referred to as Real Estate Commissions or Departments of Real Estate (DRE), are government agencies responsible for enforcing state laws that govern real estate practices. Their primary role is to:

Ensuring that all real estate agents, brokers, and firms are properly licensed.
	•	Monitor Compliance: 
Ensuring that real estate professionals follow legal and ethical standards.
	•	Enforce Disciplinary Actions:

	•	Adhere to the Code of Ethics established by governing bodies, maintaining integrity and fairness in all transactions.
Why Licensing Compliance Matters
	•	Consumer Protection: 
License regulators play a crucial role in protecting the public from unqualified or unethical real estate professionals. By ensuring that our agents are fully licensed and trained, we provide a safe and reliable experience for clients.
	•	Professionalism: 
Following licensing rules fosters a professional environment that builds trust with clients, partners, and the broader real estate community. At One Drive Realty, this professionalism is foundational to our success.

The failure to require performance of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at any other time after that, nor will a waiver by us of any breach or default of these Terms of Service, or any provision of these Terms of Service, be a waiver of any subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself.

Upon termination of these Terms of Service, Sections 2 and 3 through 20, along with the Privacy Policy and any other accompanying agreements, will survive.
19. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration.  19.1. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and OneDrive Realty, in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and OneDrive Realty, agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms of Service will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court and can be subject to extremely limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms of Service. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AND OneDrive Realty, ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.  19.2 Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 19.1, nothing in these Terms of Service will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.  19.3 Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and OneDrive Realty, will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting OneDrive Realty,  19.4 Notice, Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice”). ONEDRIVE REALTY, address for Notice is to OneDrive Realty,4106 Factoria BLVD, SE, Suite 211, Bellevue WA 98006. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or OneDrive Realty may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you, or OneDrive Realty must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, OneDrive Realty, will pay you the highest of the following:
(i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by OneDrive Realty, in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.
19.5 Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, OneDrive Realty will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the AAA Rules will decide the payment of any fees. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in King County, Washington State, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the AAA Rules will govern the payment of all fees. In that case, you agree to reimburse OneDrive Realty for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the way the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.  19.6 No Class Actions. YOU AND OneDrive Realty AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and OneDrive Realty, agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.  19.7 Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. If OneDrive Realty, makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to ONEDRIVE REALTY, address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to ONEDRIVE REALTY, address for Notice, in which case your account with OneDrive Realty, will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.
19.8 Enforceability. If Section 19.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 19 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 16 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.
20. Consent to Electronic Communications. By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in the Privacy Policy. Please read the Privacy Policy to learn more about our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing.

INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT
(Between Broker and Licensee)
This Independent Contractor Agreement (“Agreement”), dated __________ is made between One Drive Realty (ODR), and or its licensed DBA's (“Broker”) and your name: ________ (“Licensee”). In consideration of the covenants and representations contained in this Agreement, Broker and Licensee agree as follows: 
BROKER: 
Broker is duly licensed Designated-Managing Broker in Washington State, under the names of “One Drive Realty, and other registered names including 1digitalrealtor.com; 1digitalrealty.com; 1drivedata.com; 1driverealty.com; drivepixel.com. globalfaiths.net; globalfaiths.org; mlscompanies.com; onedrivedata.com; onedriverealty.com; skyperealtor.com; skyperealtors.com.” Broker will keep all license(s) current during the term of this Agreement. 
LICENSEE: 
Licensee represents that he or she is duly licensed by the State(s) of _______________________ _____________________________as a real estate broker, broker associate or salesperson, and has not used any other names within the past five years, except ___________. Licensee shall keep his/her real estate license current and active during the terms of this Agreement, including satisfying all applicable continuing education and provisional license requirements for the state in which they are licensed in. What state(s) are you joining us in__________________________? 
1.BROKER AND LICENSEE RELATIONSHIP: 
	•	Broker and licensee are independent contracting parties, and this agreement does not constitute an employment agreement by either party and shall not be construed as a partnership and Broker shall not be liable for any obligation, injury, disability, or liability incurred by licensee. 
	•	Licensee assumes and agrees to perform no other activities in association with Broker, except to solicit and obtain listings and sales of property for the parties mutual benefit, and to do so in accordance with law and with the ethical and professional standards as required so that licensee commits no act of any type for which the Real Estate Commission of the state of _____________ is authorized to suspend or to revoke a license. 
	•	 Broker shall not limit licensee’s activities to geographical areas, way services are to be performed, regarding hours, schedule, inventory, vacation, or similar activities, except to the extent required by all applicable laws, policies, and procedures. 
	•	All listings of property, and all agreements, acts or actions for performance of licensed 
acts, which are taken or performed in connection with this Agreement, shall be taken and performed in the name of the Broker. Licensee agrees and does hereby contribute
all right and title to such listings to Broker for the benefit and use of the Broker, licensee, and other licensees of the Broker. Licensee agrees to provide the Broker with a complete copy package of each closed transaction with all necessary documents. Upon termination of the licensee, if the licensee is in good standing with the Broker and has no open closings, licensee may take their listings with them*. Call for details. The licensee shall have no authority to bind the Broker by any promises or representations and the Broker shall not be liable for any obligation or liability incurred by the licensee unless the Broker specifically authorizes it in writing. 
	•	A licensee is an Independent Contractor for tax purposes and will be responsible for all tax issues at the end of each calendar year. ODR will not issue an IRS 1099 to licensee unless ODR physically pays you out of our company bank account(s) or we were issued a 1099 on your behalf. However, in some states, if we cannot get you paid from the closing table on a transaction (normally we can), and we must pay you from our account(s), we will issue you a 1099 at the end of the year. ODR does not withhold taxes or Social Security from Licensee’s compensation. Payment of taxes and Social Security contributions are Licensee’s responsibility. A licensee is considered an independent contractor, and the company does not provide a workplace or unemployment insurance. 
4. BUSINESS EXPENSES: 
Broker shall not be liable to licensee for any expenses incurred by licensee or for any of its acts. Licensee agrees to provide and pay for all necessary professional licenses and dues. Licensee understands and agrees that Broker shall not pay for any office(s), place of business, supplies, advertisements, marketing materials and that licensee is responsible for conducting business at its own costs, if any. The Broker shall not be liable to reimburse the licensee for any expenses unless specifically agreed to in writing. 
5. LICENSED ACTIVITY: 
Licensee shall be familiar with, and comply with all applicable laws, policies, and procedures, including, but not limited to anti-discrimination laws and restrictions against the giving or accepting a fee, or other things of value, for the referral of business to title companies, escrow companies, home inspection companies, pest control companies and other settlement service providers pursuant to the state in which they are licensed in & the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Acts (RESPA). 
6. COMPENSATION / COMMISSION: 
	•	Compensation shall be charged to the parties who enter into listing or buyer agreements, or for services requiring or using a real estate license. A licensee may use its own discretion regarding what commission fee to charge its clients for these services. In no event shall Broker be personally liable to licensee for licensee’s share of commissions not collected, nor shall licensee be entitled to any advance or payment from Broker upon future commissions, licensee’s only remuneration being a licensee’s share of the commission paid by the party or parties for whom the service was performed. Nor shall the licensee be personally liable to Broker for any commission not collected. The licensee shall be responsible to the broker for any previously earned sales commission, reimbursement, or rebate of any sales commission, on any successful closing. If you are buying or selling your own home, please see page 7 below in our OPPM. 
	•	Commission Schedule / Programs: Any deal where licensee has 2 sides of a single transaction is counted as 2 separate transactions. It is normally considered a “Dual Agency". ODR will collect fees for 2 transactions based on the appropriate commission plan the licensee has chosen. A licensee may change commission plans once during the calendar year at a cost of $200 payable to ODR. However, a licensee must wait 6 months from their hire date (seasoned) to be qualified to switch commission plans.  ODR will earn a fee on any real estate transaction you participate in while your license is held under our brokerage, whether or not the property is listed in the MLS, subject to applicable law and regulations. 
	•	The Flat fee 100% plan is as follows, per state: AL- $595, AZ- $595, AR- $595, CA-$695, CT- $695, FL- $495, GA- $595, IN- $595, LA- $595, MD- $595, MA- $695, MI- $595, MS- $595, NH- $595, NJ- $695, NM- $595, NY- $695, NC- $595, OR- $595, PA- $595, RI- $695, SC- $595, TN- $595, TX- $595, VA- $695, WA- $695, Wash D.C.- $595. Bump up fees will apply, see 6.2E below. The minimum due owed on this plan is the flat fee for the state you are licensed in. 
	•	The Park Your License commission plan is an 85%-15% split with 85% going to ODR on any sale transactions, referrals, rentals, leases, or standard commercial deals, so long as the licensee is not brand new. *Call for more details. The minimum due owed on this plan is the flat fee for the state you are licensed in. See 6.2A above 
	•	The Brand-New Agent plan is a 75%-25% split with 25% going to ODR. The minimum due owed on this plan is the flat fee for the state the transaction is taking place in. See 6.2A above. A brand-new agent must complete 3 sales on this plan before moving on to another plan. If moving to the Flat Fee plan after the 3 sales, the Flat Fee will be at the prevailing rate. The $200 change fee will not apply to a brand-new agent who completes their 3 sales and moves on to another plan. 
	•	The Unlimited plan is $499 per month per licensee, and you can perform as many deals as possible per month for that fee. Our "Team" plan requires a team leader to be placed on that plan. Every licensee going on the Team Plan shall pay half of the "Unlimited " plan. The team leader can have their team licensees on a different split so long as it is agreed to by both parties. The "bump up fees" from section E below will apply to the "Unlimited" and "Team" plans, depending on the state. Also, a Licensee on this plan performing "dual agency", which is having both sides of the transaction, will be charged the flat fee for their state, for the second side of that transaction. Call for details. 
	•	The following "Bump up Fees" pertain to states with a $595 Flat Fee plan: Sales at or over $500K add $399. Sales at or over $750K add $499. Sales at or over $1.0M add $599. States with a $695 Flat Fee plan: Sales at or over $1.0M add $499. Sales at or over $1.5M add $599. Sales at or over $2.0M add $699. These "bump up fees" are added in addition to the Flat Fee plan the licensee may be on.
	•	Any commission plan a licensee enters a closing with will close that transaction with the same commission plan as entered. At no time is a licensee with ODR to request, receive, ask, or authorize any closing company to release a commission check on a transaction they may be involved in. A licensee will not be paid for a closed transaction until their file is completed in our Transaction Management system (TC) and certified by our broker or manager. Signing commission instructions or unauthorized release of a commission check is grounds for termination. 
	•	Oregon & Washington state licensees only, all your contractual paperwork (including offers & any other material presented to a customer, client or other real estate broker), will need to be reviewed & initialled by our OR Broker within 7 days and WA Broker within 10 days of origination, or such other time frames as may be established pursuant to the real estate laws of each state. You will need to have a Dotloop, DocuSign or a similar account available. 
	•	Washington State licensees only, ODR will collect the appropriate B&O tax from each of your successfully closed transactions. This tax will be deducted from your commission at closing. Limited-service listings, entry only listings or auction listings are prohibited. Contact us for more details. 
	•	Florida and Michigan licensees only, we reserve the right to collect a processing/compliance fee of $395 from your buyer or seller, payable at closing to ODR, or deducted from your commission at closing. 
	•	North / South Carolina and all New England state licensees only, in the event we cannot get you paid from the closing table, we will have to deposit the entire commission check into our bank account, re-disperse to you when the check clears, and issue you a IRS 1099 at years end. There will be a $40 charge per transaction for this in North / South Carolina and a $25 charge per transaction in all New England states. 
	•	Licensee MUST CHOOSE one commission plan below: Which plan are you choosing BELOW? 
	•	100% Flat Fee 
	•	Brand New 
	•	Park License 
	•	Unlimited 
	•	Team 
	•	Other 
	•	Lead program- Anyone choosing to participate in our lead program agrees to pay the lead provider a referral fee of 30% or 35% (depending on closing sales price) for any lead that closes. In addition, any licensee on the 100% flat fee plan, or the unlimited/team plan will pay the flat fee (for their state) or 10% whichever is greater, on any closed lead sale(s). * Call for details. 
	•	Commissions on rentals, leases, referrals or commercial - You can never accept rental / lease payments or deposits. Any payment(s) shall go directly to the owner, property management or closer. Also, never accept any type of compensation about a rental or lease transaction (or any transaction period). The commission must be paid to the licensee through ODR unless we have made prior arrangements. Any transaction shall be reported to ODR within 48 hours. Any commissions to be paid to a licensee will be paid once all the appropriate documents are uploaded into our transaction management system for that transaction and certified by the broker or manager, or other arrangements are made. Referral fees shall only be paid to the Broker of any state licensed salesperson / broker in accordance with a written agreement between salespersons / broker, approved by ODR broker prior to the closing of any deals. A social security number of the referring broker or EIN number is required, along with a signature of the referring broker, to process the referral fee. The fee to ODR on any referral, rental or lease is 10%, unless the licensee is on the "Park Your License Plan" or the "Brand New Agent Plan", which would be 15% to ODR. * Call for details. Commercial deals are 15% or $500 whichever is greater, to ODR, unless the licensee is on the "Brand New Agent Plan", which would be 25% to ODR. ODR gets paid on any rental transaction you close, whether it is yours or not, and regardless of if you took a commission or not. Call for details*. 
	•	Commission payment delays & HUD homes- If a particular closing company or attorney will not honour our commission disbursement agreement (CDA), HUD will not, then you could potentially experience a delay of up to a week or more in receiving your check, while we wait to receive and process the check and for the funds to clear our bank. In the event this happens, the choice available to you, once funds have cleared, is to "quick pay" you from our bank, or to wire you the funds which will be subjected to a small wire service charge. Again, a licensee will NOT be paid on a closed transaction until their file is completed in our transaction management system (TC) and certified by our broker or manager. We reserve the right to charge an admin fee of up to $150 for each closed HUD transaction or ones where it closed with another firm, and they are paying us on behalf of one of our agents. We rarely charge it, but we reserve the right to do so. 
7. PAYPAL PAYMENTS: 
Any of our membership fees shall be paid through PayPal. You do not have to have a PayPal account, but it is paid through and collected by PayPal. Payments that are “skipped” (PayPal’s word for insufficient funds or expired credit card) 3 times or more and the profile canceled by PayPal, could result in ODR charging you a year in advance, or putting your license on inactive status. Upon termination from ODR, Licensee is to immediately cancel any recurring PayPal payment with us, to avoid any future automatic recurring payment charges. ODR will make only a $25 refund to a licensee after termination if the licensee forgot to cancel their recurring payment and was charged. Name ____________________ Initial Here 
8. COMPENSATION UPON HIRE OR AFTER TERMINATION: 
Licensee shall be entitled to compensation on transaction(s) that occurred prior to the date of termination and for which licensee has not yet been paid, so long as licensee is not in default of any provision of this agreement. The license authorizes the Broker to deduct from any commissions due at termination of this Agreement, all financial obligations owed to Broker that are imposed by the terms of this Agreement. Furthermore, in the event licensee leaves and has transaction(s) pending that require further work normally rendered by the licensee, Broker shall plan within the company to perform the required work. The Broker or licensee assigned shall be compensated for completing the pending transaction(s) and such compensation shall be deducted from the terminated licensee's share of any commission. Any transaction(s) already in closing and brought over to ODR upon hire, or released from ODR upon termination are subject to a 10% charge of gross commissions earned by the licensee who is hiring on or terminating. Any terminating licensee on the unlimited commission plan, with a pending transaction, will be charged the flat fee for their state at closing, and any bump up fees may apply. See 6.2E above. 
9. REFERRAL PROGRAM: 
Refer an agent into our firm and earn $180 every time that agent closes a sale transaction with us.

Office Policy and Procedure Manual
Introduction: 
BROKER
Broker is duly licensed Designated-Managing Broker in Washington State, under the names of “One Drive Realty,” “One Drive Realty Inc.", “One Drive Realty Independent", “ODR Independent,” "One Drive Realty", "Team ODR", "ODR Oregon Realty Group" and "ODR Washington Realty Group LLC". Broker will keep all license(s) current during the term of this Agreement. 
One Drive Realty (ODR) is a full-service real estate brokerage with its headquarters office located in Bellevue Washington. We are committed to the very highest level of professionalism to our local and national clients. Our main goal is to have complete customer satisfaction. This Policy and Procedure Manual is a reference guide on how to conduct business on a day-to-day basis. This is only a guide; Associate Licensee (agent) should always use their professional judgment. Associate Licensee (agent) understands they are not an employee of One Drive Realty, but an independent contractor. Licensee is under the direction of the broker or manager as the results of the work, but not by the methods by which such results are accomplished and will execute an Independent Contractors Agreement that defines this relationship in detail.

It is the policy of this company to always conduct ourselves in the highest ethical, professional, and competent manner when dealing with our clients, associates and the professionals of this company, other companies, other professionals, and members of the public.

Working Place: 
Broker does not provide an office space for the Licensee. A licensee may work from home, personal office, car, or any other place of the licensee’s choice. However, the licensee is responsible for storing all transaction documents in a safe place with a lock and being able to present them at the Broker’s request within 24 hours. The license must be accessible by phone, fax, e-mail, or postal mail, and respond to voicemails within a reasonable amount of time. 
Relationship of Licensee and Term: 
Licensee is not an employee, but rather an independent contractor who shall agree to our Independent Contractor Agreement. You do not have an employee-employer relationship with this company. You are considered an independent contractor for all purposes. You are associated with the Company for an unspecified term on an at-will basis. Except where it is otherwise expressly agreed in writing with the company, either party may terminate their association at any time with or without cause or reason. This office maintains the absolute right to transfer, demote, suspend, and administer independent contractor discipline at any time, for any reason, if the need arises.

Supervision: 
A licensee shall work under the supervision of their Managing Broker. Licensee assumes and agrees to perform no other activities in association with Broker, except to solicit and obtain listings and sales/rentals of property for the parties’ mutual benefit, and to do so in accordance with law and with the ethical and professional standards as required so that licensee commits no act of any type for which the Real Estate Commission of any state is authorized to suspend or to revoke a license. Licensee shall be familiar with, and comply with all applicable laws, policies, and procedures, including, but not limited to anti-discrimination laws and restrictions against the giving or accepting a fee, or other things of value, for the referral of business to title companies, escrow companies, home inspection companies, pest control companies and other settlement service providers pursuant to the state in which they are licensed in & the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Acts (RESPA). 
Licensee's Employees: 
Licensee’s employees, if any, who perform services for the broker under this agreement shall also be bound by the provision of this agreement. A licensee’s responsibilities include advising its employees of the terms of this agreement and supervising their activities to ensure their compliance with all its terms. At the request of the broker, the licensee shall provide evidence that such persons are the licensee’s employees and are bound by the provisions of this agreement. 
Transaction Management System: 
All Licensees shall use the company-approved free online transaction management. system (TC) on all real estate transactions or elect to pay ODR to manage the uploading of all documents and paperwork. All transaction files shall be complete with all the necessary documents in place and certified by the broker or manager before payment of any commissions will be released to the licensee regardless of if a deal has closed or not. In the state of Washington, if you have held your real estate license for less than 30 (thirty) months, all contracts, listings, and offers must be approved by your Managing Broker before submission to the client. 
Commission Rebates, Discounts or Credits: 
Licensees with One Drive Realty are free to negotiate their commissions in accordance with real estate law in the state in which you are licensed in. ODR will not participate in any discounting of commissions that the licensee offers their buyers or sellers. All fees owed to One Drive Realty are based on the total “Gross” commissions paid on a transaction as noted in the MLS listing or a previously signed separate commission agreement, not the rebated, discounted, or credited commission paid. Also, regarding commission discounts a licensee gives their clients: If you are on a percentage plan like the brand new agent plan of 75%-25%, and you discount or offer not to take a commission, we'll base our 25% fee on 2.5% of the closed sales price, or the commission actually offered, whichever is greater. If you are on a Flat Fee plan like the $495 plan, and you discount or offer not to take a commission, you will still owe us $495 on a closing, plus any "bump up fees" that may apply from ICA section 6.2 E above. 
Compensation, Fees and Commissions, See Also ICA: 
	•	All commissions earned by a licensee of One Drive Realty from a transaction in which you are the listing agent, selling agent or both, and for which you are the procuring cause, will be paid directly to you from the closing company in which that transaction is currently held. You will be paid based on the Commission Plan you have selected in the Independent Contractor Agreement (See ICA section 6.8) unless a different schedule has been agreed to, in or attached to an Agent contract. All payments due to you are conditioned upon review and certification of your transaction file by the broker. One Drive Realty will earn a fee on ANY transaction you participate in as long as your license is held under our broker, and regardless of if a property is listed in the MLS or not, or if you own it or not. 
	•	Any fees owed to One Drive Realty from a non “transaction” commission payment can be made via the company PayPal account or other source. Any fees that ODR may owe one of our licensee’s for recruiting fees, referral fees, or any other fees will be paid to the licensee via the company PayPal account, company check or wire, at the discretion of One Drive Realty. 
	•	Deductions- All expenses of any kind incurred by the broker on your behalf, including fees that you have agreed to pay the broker but have not been paid, will be deducted from payments due to you. 
	•	“Double Ending” a Deal- Any deal where the licensee has 2 sides of a transaction, ODR will collect fees for 2 separate transactions based on the appropriate commission plan you are on. 
	•	Transaction with multiple assessor parcel numbers (APN's)- If a transaction has multiple assessor parcel numbers (APN's), we reserve the right to charge our transaction fee based on each assessor parcel number (APN) regardless if the closer, attorney, title, or escrow company put all the APN's into 1 closing for their convenience or for the convenience of the buyer's when they take title. Call for details. 
	•	Compensation Disputes- If a dispute of any kind involving the compensation including, among other things, payment of the compensation, the amount of the compensation, or the parties entitled to the compensation, exists between or among any of the following: broker, you and another broker, a principal, or any other party involved in a transaction, the compensation will be held by the broker or manager until the dispute is resolved. You agree the broker will incur no liability for withholding payment until all disputes are fully resolved. 
	•	At no time is a licensee with ODR to request, receive, ask, or authorize any closing company to release a commission check on a transaction you may be involved in. All transaction files shall be completed in our online Transaction Management system (TC) and have been certified by the manager or broker, before a licensee can be paid directly from a closing. Unauthorized release of a commission check to a licensee is grounds for immediate termination. 
MLS Services: 
The broker is a member of various Multiple Listing Services (MLS’s) across the country. As a licensee with this office, you are encouraged to join an MLS. The MLS provides "online" computer access to a variety of services and information, including listings contained in the MLS. You are encouraged to use the online service to obtain the most current MLS information available. The broker has computers with access to the MLS. As an MLS member, you are required to adhere to the rules and regulations of the MLS. A copy of those rules and regulations is available for download from your Association of Realtors website. If you fail to comply with those rules and regulations, or fail to pay your MLS bill when due, you and/or the broker may be fined, suspended, or expelled, and your listings may be removed from the MLS. You will be responsible for payment of all fines levied against you and/or the broker resulting from your non-compliance. Furthermore, your non-compliance could result in your termination from this company. 
Flat Fee MLS Services: 
A licensee can perform these types of services if so desired, but the licensee will be required to be placed on the Unlimited Commission plan. This type of transaction will be treated just like any other and the licensee will be required to follow all ODR transaction management policies. 
Tax Reporting: 
At the end of each calendar year or as soon after as possible, all licensees should provide the Internal Revenue Service with accurate records of income earned and expenses incurred during the calendar year which may or may not have significant tax consequences. All agents are encouraged to keep accurate records of earnings and expenses. Licensees are also encouraged to get tax advice regarding these matters. ODR will not issue an IRS 1099 to a licensee unless we were issued one on behalf of a transaction the licensee participated in, or if we physically paid you on a transaction from one of our bank accounts(s). 
Real Estate Forms: 
All forms used for any transaction shall be state or Realtor® association-approved. Questionable forms shall be approved by our broker/manager for the state in which you are licensed. 
Proprietary Information / Confidentiality: 
You agree that you will not furnish to any person, business, real estate brokerage or any other entity presently existing, or to be formed in the future, any information regarding the Broker's clients, customers, properties, prices, or terms of negotiations including the broker’s policies and relationships with clients, customers or other business relations and/or the broker's business along with the following: Any files, Maps, Books, Publications, Records, Prospect or client lists, Sales plans Programs, Materials, Manuals, Forms, Brochures, Training material, Listing, sales materials, any other material, files, records or data provided by Broker. 
Any such items in your possession will be returned to the broker within 24 hours after your termination from this office. You expressly agree that all such items are the property of the broker, and you will not use these materials in connection with any real estate business continued by you, either alone or with other individuals or entities. 
The broker agrees that you are entitled, at your own expense, to photocopies of any records and files in which you have a bona fide personal, legal, or economic interest; and you may access such files only for such purposes. You agree not to sell, market to, or otherwise solicit or encourage any clients of the broker, particularly sellers with whom the broker presently holds listing agreements, to terminate their relations or contracts with the broker. 
Department of Real Estate- Licensing and Education: (Link to Our C/E Package) 
As a licensee with One Drive Realty, you are required to maintain a valid real estate license in the state in which you are licensed and keep it in good standing while associated with this company. If your license expires, is suspended, or is revoked, you may not engage in any activities on behalf of this company for which a real estate license is required. The broker may designate another company licensee to oversee your prospects, listings, and transactions during any time your license lapses, and allocate such reasonable compensation to that licensee for work performed. A licensee is responsible for meeting the education requirements of the state in which you are licensed in. If a licensee’s license status shows "expired" on the website of the state in which you are licensed at any time, licensee’s appointment will be suspended with our company until the status is back to “active” or “good standing.” 
Property Management 
An active real estate license is required for anyone interested in pursuing property management. It is an activity that very few licensees engage in. If you have an interest in this, please call us.
 Error and Omissions Insurance: 
All real estate transactions are covered under our company E & O Policy through our insurance carrier. Licenses are responsible for any deductible with respect to E and O claims regarding transactions brokered through One Drive Realty or any of its DBAs. In general, the limits of liability are $1.0M per claim and $1.0M aggregate, different limits may apply in Oregon and Washington where we have separate coverage (call for details). We have never had to use this insurance, and do not plan to. 
Automobile Insurance: 
All licensees of One Drive Realty (if you own a car) shall have current automobile insurance. You shall maintain on file with this office proof of current insurance coverage for liability and property damage in the minimum amounts that your state requires. ODR shall be held harmless against any claims or demands resulting from any automobile accident of the licensee or because of the licensee’s default in this paragraph. 
Trust Funds and Earnest Monies: 
The licensee acknowledges and understands that the Broker DOES NOT maintain a trust fund account and that any earnest money deposits shall NEVER ever be touched by the licensee. DO NOT touch client's checks, monies, or funds. The mishandling of trust funds is the number one reason real estate agents and brokers have their licenses suspended or revoked. Under NO circumstances is a licensee to accept earnest money deposit checks, monies, or funds. A licensee should notify their client(s) immediately to arrange for any earnest money deposits needing to be delivered and submitted and then it should be reported to the broker. Do not manage money in any form including checks, money orders, cash or otherwise, regarding good faith deposits, appraisals, home inspections, repairs, credit reports, or other service providers. Have your client deliver or send closing deposits directly to the closing company or pay for inspections or appraisals at time of service. Give clients the information needed for them to mail or drop off deposits directly to the closer within three business days after acceptance of an offer. 
WIRE Fraud Advisory: 
Do not allow any attorney, title, or escrow company to send, email or fax you wire instructions for you to forward to your clients, for any potential closing. These secure instructions NEED to be sent directly to your clients from the attorney, title, or escrow company. 
Marketing and Advertising: 
All advertising and marketing materials need to receive approval from the broker or manager of ODR. All licensees shall strictly adhere to any state or federal "do not call" list regulations. Failure to do so may result in immediate termination. 
Lockboxes and Signs: (Link to CYPS Page) 
The licensee is responsible for ordering and purchasing all signs (outside of the free ones we offer) and lockboxes from vendors. It is best to call your local Realtor® association for more details regarding lockboxes. We do have a brief list of sign vendors if necessary. 
Discrimination: 
One Drive Realty does not discriminate, nor should the licensee, based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, family status, sexual orientation, or disability. It is the law. All licensees are expected to assist all customers in purchasing, selling or obtaining financing. Licensee shall comply with all federal, state, and local fair housing laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Fair Housing Act, and shall not discriminate against any person based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity. 
Maintaining Files: 
Your files are a record of every event relative to your dealings with your clients on a listing or sale transaction. You shall retain copies of all listings, deposit receipts, and other documents executed by you or obtained by you in connection with a real estate transaction, whether the sale is consummated or not. You shall maintain a neat and orderly file on every listing and sale on which you work. All files are the property of the company and are to remain either in your possession or the company until the file is closed. 
Litigation and Claims Handling: 
You are required to: 
Promptly notify your broker/manager of any claim or potential claim made against you and or the company. This includes any demand received by you for money or services alleging a negligent act or omission; any notification of the commencement of a Lawsuit, arbitration, or mediation process; or any written or verbal notice or threat that anyone intends to hold you and/or the company responsible for any alleged wrongdoing. Cooperate with the company in the defense of the claim. Promptly pay to the company any amounts due here upon notice to you from the company. This includes attorney's fees, and the cost of any settlement or a judgment (collectively the "costs of defense"), shall be allocated between the company and you in the same percentages as per your Independent Contractor Agreement or prospective transaction that led to the claim, whether or not the transaction actually closed. You will be responsible for all costs of a claim if you fail to follow any law, regulation or company policy as set forth in this policy manual, and that failure results in a judgment or other final adjudication based on that failure. You will be solely responible, and shall reimburse the company, for all the company's costs of defense if a judgment or other final adjudication on any claim adverse to the company arises from you that establishes dishonest, fraudulent, criminal, or malicious acts, errors of omissions were committed or results in a finding of intentional tort, slander, defamation or any conduct which leads to the imposition of punitive, exemplary or multiple damages, or fines or penalties, or establishes discrimination on the basis of race, creed, religion, ethnic background, national origin, age, sex, handicap, familial status, physical disability, sexual preference, or any other unlawful classification.
Disputes During Closing: 
If a dispute arises during closing between buyer and seller, buyer, the cooperating broker and/or the company, which cannot be resolved by negotiations between the parties and the agent(s) involved, and the company determines that it is in the best interest of the company to resolve the matter during escrow rather than risk a potential claim or litigation after closing; then company broker has the right to negotiate a resolution of the dispute which may involve a reduction in the commission to be received, or a credit given to one of the parties. In that event, and regardless of actual company or agent liability or responsibility in the dispute, the agent(s) and the company will participate in the commission reduction or credit pro rata. 
Sexual Harassment Policy: 
One Drive Realty disapproves of and does not tolerate Sexual harassment or harassment of any kind. All licensees shall avoid offensive or inappropriate sexual behavior and are responsible for assuring that their workplace is always free from sexual harassment. One Drive Realty prohibits: unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual acts or favors, with or without accompanying promises, threats or reciprocal favors or actions, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature which creates a hostile or offensive working environment. Complaints of sexual harassment will be promptly and carefully investigated, and all licensees are assured that they will be free from any reprisal or retaliation for filing such complaints. Any licensee who has a complaint of sexual harassment by anyone should immediately bring the complaint to the attention of the broker. Office investigations will include interviews with all relevant persons, including the complainant, the accused, and other potential witnesses. Licensees are assured that the privacy of the complainant and the person accused of sexual harassment will be kept strictly confidential. The broker will review the findings with the complainant at the conclusion of the investigation. If the investigation reveals that the complaint is valid, immediate, and appropriate corrective action, up to and including termination will be taken to stop the harassment and prevent its recurrence. If the validity of the complaint cannot be determined, immediate and appropriate action will be taken to ensure that all parties are acquainted with this sexual harassment policy and to avoid sexual harassment in the future. 
One Drive Realty will provide regular training on sexual harassment prevention and maintain a clear reporting procedure for any incidents of harassment. 
Referrals of Vendors: 
ODR is NOT in the home inspection, escrow, title, photography, or contractor business. If a licensee chooses to refer clients to providers of such services, ODR policy is for the licensee to assemble a list of at least three vendors and provide the list to the client. Licensee shall comply with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and shall not accept any compensation or thing of value for referrals to settlement service providers, except as expressly permitted by law. 

Buying, Selling, Building or Renting Your Own Properties: 
	•	You can buy or sell your own properties in accordance with our E&O policy provided: 
	•	We need complete documentation on any personal transaction you do whether it was entered into the MLS or not. 
	•	An accredited written home inspection report was issued in connection with the transaction, or a waiver was executed by the buyer. 
	•	A home warranty was purchased by the buyer or paid for by the seller or a waiver was executed by the buyer. 
	•	A seller’s disclosure form was signed and acknowledged by the buyer prior to the closing and the licensee must disclose their real estate license. 
	•	An approved state “Purchase Contract” was used in the transaction. 
	•	A licensee of One Drive Realty was not the buyer’s agent*. 
	•	You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the broker from all claims against you and/or your broker in charge or manager arising out of your personal transactions. 
	•	The sale, purchase or rental of your properties is treated as a normal transaction regarding the commission plan you have chosen in the independent contractor agreement (See ICA section 6.8), and what is owed to ODR. One Drive Realty will collect the appropriate commission fee based on that plan, regardless of if the home was on any MLS or not. 
	•	We do not allow transactions that contain language referring to "purchase/lease", "rent to own", or "assignee" options in any part of any contract, counter offers, addendums etc., without prior written consent from your Broker in Charge. 
	•	If you are not taking a commission on the sale or rental of your own properties, we will base our fee owed at closing on the commission plan you chose in the ICA. If you are on a % plan like the 85%-15% plan for example, we will base our 15% fee on 2.5% of the closed sales price, or the commission offered. If you are on a Flat Fee plan like the $495 plan, you will owe us $495 on a successful sale closing, plus any "bump up fees" that may apply, from the ICA section 6.2 E above. On rentals, we will take 10% of the commission offered. If no commission is offered, we base our 10% on 2.5% of the yearly rental lease. If you buy your own properties with or without a commission offered, regardless of if it was on the MLS, the above will apply as well. In summary, we earn our respective fees regardless of whether the sale, purchase or rental was your private property transaction or not. Call for more details and clarity. 
Offers To Purchase: 
Remember, you shall present all offers to the listing agent, even if the property is closed, unless the listing agent or seller has given you written instructions to the contrary. Upon receiving offers from buyers, review it thoroughly for completeness, accuracy, and clarity. It is important to pay close attention to the time limits set out in the offer, ESPECIALLY the time within which the seller must respond. You are encouraged to call/contact the Broker/manager for assistance. Next, you may want to call the listing agent, obtain any relevant background information about the buyer, and clarify any ambiguities in the offer. Notify the listing agent promptly that you have received the offer. Then make an appointment as soon as possible to present the offer to the listing agent.
Refer to the MLS Rules and Regulations for Selling Agent’s right to present in person. As with all contracts, you must obtain all parties' signatures. If a party signs on behalf of another, you must have evidence of that person's authority to do so in writing. If you must present an offer missing a signature, you must disclose this fact to the seller/listing agent. Be sure to condition the offer on the obtaining of any missing signature(s). If your clients receive a counteroffer, be sure the terms are clear and complete. Be sure to review it against the offer to purchase. Remember, if there is no meeting of the minds there is no contract. NOTE: You shall adhere to all time requirements stated in the purchase agreement and closing instructions unless all parties agree in writing to the contrary. Never use outdated forms. 
Listings: 
Any listing(s) taken by a licensee shall be uploaded to our Transaction Management system (TC) and a copy of the MLS “print out” supplied to ODR (if on the MLS) within 48 hours of taking the listing(s). Listing(s) are the property of the brokerage. Listings not in an open closing are only released upon termination on a case-by-case basis depending on the situation of the licensee and the objectives of the seller. Within 48 hours after notice of termination by either party, the licensee shall provide the broker or manager with a list of all active listing(s) taken by you, and all pending transactions in which, if completed, you will be entitled to compensation from the company in accordance with the terms of your ICA, or other written agreement. 
Loan Modifications or Business Brokering 
We do NOT allow loan modifications or business brokering as a licensee of our company. We do not carry E&O insurance for this type of activity. Performing either of these activities will be grounds for termination from our company. 
Short Sale Negotiating 
We allow the negotiating of short sales by a licensee of One Drive Realty only after approval is given by your manager or Broker in charge. 
Garnishing of Wages: 
One Drive Realty does not participate in any "garnishing, collecting, holding, or securing" of your wages in any fashion. If any entity including city, county, or state "asks, demands or requires" us to garnish your wages for any reason, we reserve the right to terminate your license and affiliation with us at any time. Some of the reasons for garnishment could include child support, alimony, or taxes, just to name a few. We are simply not set up from an administrative standpoint to be able to manage the many jurisdictions, paperwork and recording keeping that would be involved. 
Termination: 
Your association with the company can be terminated by either party, with or without cause, at any time upon written notice given to the other party. If this agreement is terminated while you have listings or pending transactions that require further work normally rendered by you, the broker may plan with another salesperson in the company to perform the required work. The licensee performing the work shall be compensated for completing the work, and such reasonable compensation shall be deducted from your share of the commission. At no time will commission plan payment refunds be given to an agent or broker associate upon termination unless otherwise agreed to in writing, in advance. 
Office Meetings and Email: 
One Drive Realty does not hold weekly office meetings because we have no offices for you to come into to. A licensee may work from home, personal office, vehicle, or any other place of the icensee’s choice. In lieu of such meetings, the broker or manager will communicate important announcements via e-mail, phone, or text. You shall have a working e-mail address and check it regularly, including spam. (Corporate additional email can be purchased from ODR)
