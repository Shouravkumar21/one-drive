When a referred client completes a transaction, the referring agent receives a referral fee as a percentage of the transaction value or a flat fee, depending on the service.\n\n• Referral Process:\n\nAgents can refer clients through a simple process, typically by submitting the client’s information to One Drive Realty. The referral must be documented to ensure that the referring agent receives credit once the transaction is completed.\n\nReferral Fee Percentages and Amounts\n\n• Varied Rates:\n\nThe referral fees at One Drive Realty can range from 0.25% to 25% of the transaction value, depending on the specific product or service being referred.

For example, higher percentages may be offered for more complex or higher-value transactions, while standard services may have lower referral fees.\n\n• Consideration of the Referral's Quality:\n\nOne Drive Realty may also consider the quality and potential value of the referral when determining the referral bonus. Referrals that lead to long-term client relationships or multiple transactions may qualify for higher bonuses.\n\n• Periodic Review:\n\nThe criteria for referral bonuses are subject to periodic review and adjustment based on market conditions and the success of the referral program. One Drive Realty aims to ensure that the program remains competitive and rewarding for participating agents.\n\nOne Drive Realty’s referral fee program offers agents a lucrative opportunity to earn additional income by referring clients to our services.

    "title": "UNIT SHARE CERT",
    "content": "At One Drive Realty, we offer an innovative approach to real estate investment through Unit Share Certificates. This method provides a flexible and accessible way for investors to gain exposure to real estate without the complexities of traditional property ownership. Unit Share Certificates represent a portion of ownership in a real estate asset or portfolio, allowing investors to benefit from property appreciation and income generation without directly managing the property.\n\nWhat Are Unit Share Certificates?\n\nUnit Share Certificates are a form of investment that allows individuals to own a share of a real estate asset. Each certificate represents a fractional ownership of a property or a group of properties, giving investors a stake in the income and value generated by those assets.\n\nBenefits of Unit Share Certificates\n\n• Accessibility:\n\nUnit Share Certificates lower the barrier to entry for real estate investment. Instead of needing substantial capital to purchase an entire property, investors can buy shares, making it easier to diversify their portfolio.\n\n• Diversification:\n\nBy investing in Unit Share Certificates, you can spread your investment across multiple properties, reducing risk and potentially increasing returns.\n\n• Passive Income:\n\nInvestors in Unit Share Certificates can earn passive income from rental yields or other revenue generated by the underlying properties, without the need to manage the property themselves.\n\n• Liquidity:\n\nUnlike traditional real estate investments, which can be difficult to sell quickly, Unit Share Certificates can often be sold more easily, providing investors with greater liquidity.\n\n• Professional Management:\n\nThe properties underlying the Unit Share Certificates are typically managed by experienced real estate professionals, ensuring that they are maintained and operated efficiently.\n\nHow Unit Share Certificates Work\n\n• Investment:\n\nInvestors purchase Unit Share Certificates, which represent a portion of ownership in a real estate asset or portfolio.\n\n• Income Distribution:\n\nInvestors receive a share of the income generated by the property, such as rental income, based on the number of shares they own.\n\n• Appreciation:\n\nAs the value of the underlying property increases, the value of the Unit Share Certificates may also rise, providing capital appreciation to the investor.\n\n• Liquidity Options:\n\nDepending on the terms of the investment, investors may have the option to sell their Unit Share Certificates, providing a potential exit strategy.\n\nUnit Share Certificates vs. Traditional Property Ownership\n\n• Lower Capital Requirements:\n\nUnlike traditional property ownership, which requires significant upfront capital, Unit Share Certificates allow investors to participate in real estate with a smaller financial commitment.\n\n• No Management Responsibilities:\n\nInvestors do not need to worry about property management, as this is handled by professionals.\n\n• Flexibility and Liquidity:\n\nUnit Share Certificates offer more flexibility and liquidity compared to owning physical property, making them an attractive option for many investors.\n\nIs Unit Share Certificate Investment Right for You?\n\nUnit Share Certificates can be an excellent choice for investors looking to diversify their portfolio, gain exposure to real estate, and generate passive income without the complexities of direct property ownership. However, like all investments, they come with risks, and it’s essential to understand the specific terms and conditions associated with the certificates you’re considering.\n\nAt One Drive Realty, we are committed to providing our investors with the information and support they need to make informed decisions. If you’re interested in exploring Unit Share Certificates as part of your investment strategy, now is the time to do it.

    "content": "At One Drive Realty, we recognize the importance of innovative and sustainable building practices, which is why we offer services related to envelope structures in real estate development. An envelope structure refers to the outer shell of a building, designed to protect the interior from external elements while maintaining energy efficiency and structural integrity.\n\nWhat Are Envelope Structures?\n\nThe building envelope consists of all the elements of a structure that separate the interior from the exterior. This includes walls, roofs, windows, doors, and foundations. The envelope plays a crucial role in determining the energy efficiency, comfort, and durability of a building.\n\nKey Components of Envelope Structures\n\n• Walls:\n\nThe exterior walls provide structural support and protect the interior from weather conditions. They also contribute to insulation and overall energy efficiency.\n\n• Roof:\n\nThe roof is a vital part of the envelope, shielding the building from rain, snow, and sunlight. A well-designed roof helps regulate temperature and prevent energy loss.\n\n• Windows and Doors:\n\nWindows and doors are essential for ventilation, natural light, and access. However, they can also be points of energy loss if not properly designed and sealed.\n\n• Insulation:\n\nInsulation within the walls, roof, and foundation helps maintain a consistent interior temperature, reducing the need for heating and cooling.\n\n• Air Barriers:\n\nThese prevent air leakage, which can significantly impact energy efficiency. Proper sealing of the envelope ensures that air does not escape, keeping the building's interior comfortable.\n\nBenefits of High-Quality Envelope Structures\n\n• Energy Efficiency:\n\nA well-designed building envelope reduces energy consumption by minimizing heat loss in the winter and heat gain in the summer. This leads to lower energy bills and a smaller carbon footprint.\n\n• Comfort:\n\nMaintaining a stable indoor temperature and controlling humidity levels contributes to the comfort of the building's occupants.\n\n• Durability:\n\nA robust envelope structure protects the building from external elements, such as moisture, wind, and temperature fluctuations, enhancing its lifespan.\n\n• Sustainability:\n\nBy improving energy efficiency and reducing the need for artificial heating and cooling, high-quality envelope structures contribute to environmental sustainability.\n\n• Cost Savings:\n\nOver time, the energy savings from an efficient envelope can offset the initial investment, making it a cost-effective solution for property owners.\n\nEnvelope Structures and One Drive Realty\n\nAt One Drive Realty, we understand that the envelope structure is a critical component of any real estate development. Our team of experts is dedicated to ensuring that every project we undertake incorporates state-of-the-art envelope designs that meet the highest standards of energy efficiency, comfort, and sustainability.\n\nWe work closely with architects, engineers, and contractors to deliver buildings with superior envelope structures that not only meet but exceed industry standards.

    "content": "A 1031 exchange is a powerful tax-deferral strategy in real estate that allows investors to sell a property and reinvest the proceeds in a new, like-kind property, deferring capital gains taxes. Here’s how it works and how One Drive Realty can assist:\n\nTypes of Properties That Qualify for a 1031 Exchange:\n\n• Investment and Business Properties:\n\nTo qualify for a 1031 exchange, the properties involved must be held for investment purposes or used in a business or trade. This includes residential rental properties, commercial buildings, vacant land, and industrial properties.\n\n• Like-Kind Properties:\n\nThe properties exchanged must be of “like-kind,” meaning they must be similar in nature or character, even if they differ in grade or quality. For example, you can exchange an apartment building for a commercial office space, but not for a personal residence.\n\nHow One Drive Realty Facilitates the 1031 Exchange Process:\n\n• Identification of Replacement Property:\n\nOne Drive Realty helps clients identify suitable replacement properties that meet the criteria for a 1031 exchange. Our expertise ensures that the properties are truly “like-kind” and qualify under IRS guidelines.\n\n• Coordination and Documentation:\n\nWe work closely with qualified intermediaries, who are essential in the 1031 exchange process, to handle the funds and ensure compliance with IRS rules. One Drive Realty assists with the necessary documentation, making the process smooth and efficient.\n\n• Timeline Management:\n\nThe 1031 exchange process has strict deadlines, including a 45-day window to identify a replacement property and a 180-day period to complete the exchange. One Drive Realty helps manage these timelines to ensure that clients meet all requirements.\n\nTax Benefits of a 1031 Exchange:\n\n• Deferral of Capital Gains Taxes:\n\nThe primary benefit of a 1031 exchange is the deferral of capital gains taxes that would otherwise be due upon the sale of an investment property. This allows investors to reinvest the full proceeds from the sale into a new property, maximizing their buying power.\n\n• Wealth Accumulation:\n\nBy deferring taxes, investors can leverage their entire investment to purchase higher-value properties or multiple properties, potentially increasing their returns and building wealth more rapidly.\n\n• Portfolio Diversification:\n\nA 1031 exchange allows investors to diversify their real estate holdings by exchanging one type of property for another, such as moving from a residential rental property to a commercial asset, without triggering immediate tax liabilities.\n\nAt One Drive Realty, we are committed to helping our clients navigate the complexities of a 1031 exchange. By leveraging our expertise and resources, you can take full advantage of this tax-deferral strategy to grow and diversify your real estate investments.\n\nReady to explore how 1031 Exchange can benefit you?

    "content": "BLOG # 01\n\nNavigating the Real Estate Market: A Comprehensive Guide for Buyers and Sellers\n\nThe real estate market is a dynamic and ever-evolving landscape influenced by factors such as economic conditions, interest rates, housing demand, and consumer preferences. Whether you're a first-time homebuyer, a seasoned investor, or someone looking to sell your property, understanding key dynamics is essential to making informed decisions. This guide will explore the essentials of buying and selling real estate, providing practical insights and strategies to help you navigate the complexities of the market with confidence.\n\nThe Real Estate Market: An Overview\n\nReal estate can be broadly classified into residential, commercial, multifamily, and industrial sectors. The residential market, which deals with homes, apartments, and condominiums, often receives the most attention.\n\nSeveral key factors shape the real estate market:\n\n• Interest Rates: Low-interest rates can stimulate housing demand by making borrowing more affordable, while high rates can slow down the market.\n• Supply and Demand: A buyer’s market occurs when there are more homes than potential buyers, while a seller’s market happens when there are more buyers than available properties.\n• Economic Conditions: Economic growth typically boosts consumer confidence and encourages property investment, whereas downturns often lead to market stagnation.\n\nFor Buyers: Key Considerations Before Purchasing\n\nBuying a home is one of the most significant financial investments many will make in their lifetime. To ensure a successful transaction, consider the following:\n\n• Assess Your Financial Situation Begin by determining how much you can afford based on your income, debt, and savings. It’s essential to:\n• Identify Your Needs and Wants Outline what you’re looking for in a property, such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and amenities. Prioritize essential features versus desirable ones to stay focused during your search.\n• Research the Neighborhood The location is key in real estate. Investigate neighborhoods that fit your lifestyle, considering aspects like commute times, school quality, crime rates, and property value trends.\n• Home Inspections and Appraisals Once you’ve found a property, a home inspection can reveal potential issues, while an appraisal ensures the property’s value aligns with the purchase price.\n• Budget for Closing Costs Aside from the down payment, you’ll need to account for closing costs, typically 2-5% of the purchase price. These include fees for appraisals, attorney services, title insurance, and more.\n\nFor Sellers: Strategies to Maximize Your Home's Value\n\nIf you're selling your home, you can take several steps to increase its value and ensure a smooth sale:\n\n• Set the Right Price A competitive price is critical to attracting buyers. A real estate agent can help you conduct a comparative market analysis (CMA) to determine an accurate listing price.\n• Stage Your Home First impressions matter. Clean, declutter, and rearrange furniture to make your home more appealing. Consider professional staging services to showcase the property’s best features.\n• Effective Marketing A comprehensive marketing strategy is essential to reach potential buyers. Utilize professional photography, virtual tours, and list your property on high-traffic platforms like Zillow, Realtor.com, and social media.\n• Be Flexible with Showings Being available for showings increases the chance of attracting buyers. Try to accommodate weekend and evening visits to maximize exposure.\n• Negotiate Smartly When reviewing offers, don’t focus solely on price. Consider factors like contingencies, financing, and the buyer’s flexibility on the closing date. Work with your real estate agent to secure the best terms.\n\nCurrent Trends in Real Estate\n\nBeing aware of current real estate trends can help both buyers and sellers make smarter decisions. Some of the key trends include:\n\n• Virtual Tours: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual tours have become more popular, allowing buyers to view properties remotely.\n• Sustainability: Energy-efficient homes and green building practices are on the rise, as more buyers prioritize sustainability.\n• Suburban Shift: Many buyers are moving away from urban centers to suburban or rural areas, looking for larger properties with outdoor space, especially as remote work becomes more common.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe real estate market can be complex, but understanding the key factors and working with experienced professionals will enable you to make informed decisions. Buyers should assess their financial readiness, research neighborhoods, and carefully consider their priorities, while sellers should focus on pricing, staging, and marketing their properties effectively.\n\nWhether you’re buying or selling, staying informed about current market conditions is crucial.

    "content": "Commercial real estate is a lucrative segment that involves the buying, selling, and leasing of properties used for business purposes. These include office buildings, retail spaces, industrial properties, and multifamily complexes. The commercial market tends to be more complex than residential real estate, requiring in-depth knowledge of zoning laws, financing options, and market trends. One Drive Realty excels in helping investors and business owners navigate this intricate landscape to make informed decisions and maximize their returns.\n\nKey Aspects of Commercial Real Estate:\n\nTypes of Commercial Properties:\n\n• Office Spaces:\n\nFrom small office buildings to corporate headquarters, office real estate is a vital sector for companies seeking functional and modern workplaces.\n\n• Retail Spaces:\n\nShopping centers, strip malls, and stand-alone retail buildings fall under this category.

These properties have seen increased demand with the rise of e-commerce and supply chain developments.\n\n• Multifamily Complexes:\n\nWhile technically residential, large apartment buildings and other multifamily complexes are treated as commercial investments due to their scale. One Drive Realty assists investors in evaluating cash flow potential and tenant management.\n\nCommercial Real Estate Financing:\n\n• Loan Options:\n\nFinancing for commercial real estate often requires larger down payments and different terms than residential properties. One Drive Realty works with lenders to secure favorable financing, including SBA loans, commercial mortgages, and bridge loans.\n\n• Investment Returns:\n\nCommercial real estate often provides higher returns compared to residential properties, thanks to longer leases and higher rental income. One Drive Realty helps investors calculate returns, factoring in variables such as maintenance costs, vacancy rates, and property taxes.\n\nCommercial Property Leasing:\n\n• Long-Term Leases:\n\nCommercial properties typically have long-term leases, often spanning five to 10 years, providing stability for property owners. One Drive Realty negotiates favorable lease terms that benefit both landlords and tenants.\n\n• Triple Net Leases (NNN):\n\nThese leases place responsibility for property taxes, insurance, and maintenance on the tenant, offering significant financial advantages to the property owner.\n\nMarket Trends and Development:\n\n• Post-Pandemic Recovery:\n\nThe commercial real estate sector has experienced shifts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly in office spaces and retail. Businesses are opting for hybrid work models, and online shopping has reduced the demand for brick-and-mortar stores.

    "content": "At One Drive Realty, understanding key real estate metrics is essential for making informed investment decisions. Three crucial terms in our industry are Cap Rate (Capitalization Rate), Rate of Return (ROR), and Real Estate Owned (REO). Here’s how these terms are relevant to our services and how clients can benefit from them:\n\nCap Rate (Capitalization Rate):\n\n• What It Is:\n\nThe Cap Rate is a vital metric used to assess the potential return on an investment property. It is calculated by dividing the property’s net operating income (NOI) by its current market value or purchase price.\n\n• Relevance to One Drive Realty:\n\nWe use Cap Rate to evaluate and compare different properties, ensuring that our clients invest in assets that offer the best return relative to their cost. Our expertise in analyzing Cap Rates allows us to identify high-potential properties that align with our clients’ financial goals.\n\n• Client Benefits:\n\nBy understanding Cap Rate, clients can quickly assess the profitability of various real estate investments. This knowledge empowers them to make strategic choices that maximize their returns.\n\nRate of Return (ROR):\n\n• What It Is:\n\nThe Rate of Return (ROR) measures the overall profitability of an investment over time. It reflects the percentage gain or loss relative to the initial amount invested, making it a critical factor in long-term investment planning.\n\n• Relevance to One Drive Realty:\n\nOur team at One Drive Realty uses ROR to track the performance of investment properties. By analyzing ROR, we help clients understand how their investments are performing and guide them in optimizing their portfolios for sustained growth.\n\n• Client Benefits:\n\nUnderstanding ROR enables clients to evaluate the effectiveness of their investments, adjust their strategies as needed, and set realistic expectations for future returns.\n\nReal Estate Owned (REO):\n\n• What It Is:\n\nReal Estate Owned (REO) refers to properties that have been repossessed by lenders, typically after foreclosure. These properties are often available at discounted prices, presenting unique opportunities for savvy investors.\n\n• Relevance to One Drive Realty:\n\nOne Drive Realty specializes in identifying and acquiring REO properties for our clients. By including these properties in our offerings, we provide clients with access to valuable investment opportunities that can enhance their portfolios.\n\n• Client Benefits:\n\nClients who are familiar with REO properties can take advantage of lower purchase prices and the potential for significant returns.

    "title": "CAPITALIZATION RATE",
    "content": "At One Drive Realty, we understand that real estate investment success depends heavily on assessing returns and understanding the financial metrics that drive profitability. One of the key measures for real estate investors is the capitalization rate, commonly referred to as the Cap Rate. It's essential for evaluating income-producing properties and determining the potential return on investment.\n\nWhat is Capitalization Rate (Cap Rate)?\n\nThe Cap Rate is a metric used to calculate the expected rate of return on a real estate investment property. It is expressed as a percentage and represents the ratio of the property’s Net Operating Income (NOI) to its current market value or purchase price. Essentially, the Cap Rate gives investors a clear snapshot of what the property will yield as an annual return, assuming the investment is made without debt (i.e., no mortgage).\n\nHow to Calculate Cap Rate\n\nCap Rate= [Net Operating Income (NOI) / Current Market Value] × 100\n\nFor example, if a property has a NOI of $50,000 and the current market value of the property is $1,000,000, the Cap Rate is calculated as follows:\n\nCap Rate= [50,000/1,000,000] × 100 = 5%\n\nThis means the property would generate a 5% annual return on investment.\n\nWhy Cap Rate Matters in Real Estate\n\n• Evaluating Property Profitability:\n\nCap Rate is a vital tool for investors to quickly assess the profitability of a real estate investment. It helps compare properties on an \"apples-to-apples\" basis, allowing investors to determine which investments yield the highest returns.\n\n• Risk Assessment:\n\nCap Rates are closely linked to the risk associated with a property. Properties with higher Cap Rates often come with greater risk but also offer higher returns, such as in emerging or less stable markets. Conversely, lower Cap Rates are associated with safer investments in more stable markets but tend to provide lower returns.\n\n• Market Indicator:\n\nThe Cap Rate reflects the overall market condition in a specific location. A high Cap Rate might indicate a buyer's market, where prices are low relative to the income generated. Conversely, a low Cap Rate often indicates a seller's market, where prices are higher and returns are lower.\n\nCap Rate at One Drive Realty\n\nAt One Drive Realty, we specialize in helping clients understand and utilize the Cap Rate to make informed investment decisions. Whether you are interested in residential properties, multifamily units, commercial real estate, or vacant land, the Cap Rate is crucial to ensuring that your investment aligns with your financial goals.\n\n• Residential Real Estate:\n\nTypically, Cap Rates for residential properties tend to be lower (3-6%) in established neighborhoods with less risk, but offer steady, reliable returns over time.\n\n• Multifamily Properties:\n\nMultifamily units often have slightly higher Cap Rates (5-8%) due to the potential for rental income from multiple tenants, making them an attractive option for investors looking for steady cash flow.\n\n• Commercial Properties:\n\nCommercial real estate, such as office buildings, retail spaces, and industrial properties, often features higher Cap Rates (6-10%) due to the larger size of investments and greater variability in tenant leases.\n\n• Vacant Land:\n\nWhile more speculative, vacant land typically offers high Cap Rates in emerging markets but comes with a higher degree of risk, as future development or demand may be uncertain.\n\n• Dairy Farming & Agricultural Land:\n\nCap Rates for agricultural land and farming investments vary widely depending on location and market conditions. These properties can offer steady returns through production, but market forces such as commodity prices and climate factors introduce variability.\n\nHow One Drive Realty Supports Cap Rate Analysis\n\n• Expert Analysis:\n\nOur experienced real estate professionals provide comprehensive Cap Rate assessments, helping you make data-driven decisions about your investments.\n\n• Market Insights:\n\nWe offer detailed market insights to ensure you understand the current trends and how they impact the Cap Rate in your desired investment region.\n\n• Tailored Investment Strategy:\n\nWe work with you to develop a customized investment strategy that maximizes Cap Rate potential while balancing risk and long-term return objectives.\n\nUnderstanding the Cap Rate is crucial for any real estate investor looking to assess the profitability and risk of their investments. At One Drive Realty, we empower our clients with the knowledge and tools needed to make sound, strategic investments in properties across various categories, including residential, multifamily, commercial, and agricultural sectors. Contact us at info@onedriverealty.com and let us help you achieve your financial goals by optimizing your real estate investments using Cap Rate analysis."

    "title": "BUILD 2 SUIT PROFIT",
    "content": "The Build-to-Suit (BTS) model offers a strategic opportunity for investors and developers looking to maximize returns while minimizing risks. This model revolves around constructing properties specifically tailored to the needs of a tenant, typically within the commercial real estate sector. One Drive Realty provides comprehensive support for investors throughout the BTS process, ensuring projects are aligned with tenant expectations and generate optimal financial outcomes.\n\nBenefits of the Build-to-Suit Model:\n\n• Guaranteed Tenants One of the most attractive features of the Build-to-Suit model is the security it offers. In most cases, tenants are secured before construction even begins. This approach guarantees immediate occupancy once the project is completed, significantly reducing the financial risks associated with vacant properties and ensuring that you have a steady stream of income from day one.\n• Tailored Customization In the Build-to-Suit model, every aspect of the construction is designed with the tenant's specific needs in mind. Whether it's the layout, technology integration, or specialized infrastructure, the property is customized to meet the exact requirements of the tenant. This results in long-term lease stability, as tenants are more likely to stay in a space built to their specifications.\n• Premium Rental Rates Because the property is designed precisely to meet the needs of the tenant, investors can typically command higher rental rates compared to traditional properties. The combination of a secure tenant, custom-built space, and high demand for specialized real estate leads to increased profitability for the developer and investor.\n• Reduced Vacancy Risks With a pre-leased, purpose-built property, the chances of facing vacancies or turnover costs are significantly lower. The tailored nature of the building also reduces the risk of tenant dissatisfaction, ensuring they are likely to extend leases or renew contracts.\n• Long-Term Investment Stability The Build-to-Suit model offers long-term investment security. Tenants in BTS properties often sign extended leases, ensuring predictable revenue over time. This makes it easier to plan and manage finances, with the added benefit of reducing the operational risks associated with short-term leases or frequent tenant turnover.\n\nWhy Choose One Drive Realty for Your Build-to-Suit Projects?\n\nOne Drive Realty offers hands-on expertise, guiding you through each phase of the Build-to-Suit process—from initial project consultation to securing tenants and overseeing construction. With a deep understanding of commercial real estate, we help developers, investors, and property owners capitalize on this model’s advantages, while ensuring projects are completed efficiently, on time, and within budget.

Dispute Resolution and Arbitration. 19.1. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and OneDrive Realty, in the most expedient and cost-effective manner, you and OneDrive Realty, agree that every dispute arising in connection with these Terms of Service will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court and can be subject to extremely limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms of Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of these Terms of Service. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE, YOU AND OneDrive Realty, ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. 19.2 Exceptions. Despite the provisions of Section 19.1, nothing in these Terms of Service will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim. 19.3 Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and OneDrive Realty, will be settled under the Federal Arbitration Act, and governed by the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these Terms of Service, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting OneDrive Realty, 19.4 Notice, Process. A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if such other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice”). ONEDRIVE REALTY, address for Notice is to OneDrive Realty,4106 Factoria BLVD, SE, Suite 211, Bellevue WA 98006. The Notice must: (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or OneDrive Realty may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you, or OneDrive Realty must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor, OneDrive Realty, will pay you the highest of the following:\n\n(i) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (ii) the last written settlement amount offered by OneDrive Realty, in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (iii) $1,000.\n\n19.5 Fees. If you commence arbitration in accordance with these Terms of Service, OneDrive Realty will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $10,000, in which case the AAA Rules will decide the payment of any fees. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in King County, Washington State, but if the claim is for $10,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the AAA Rules will govern the payment of all fees. In that case, you agree to reimburse OneDrive Realty for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the way the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits. 19.6 No Class Actions. YOU AND OneDrive Realty AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and OneDrive Realty, agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. 19.7 Modifications to this Arbitration Provision. If OneDrive Realty, makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to ONEDRIVE REALTY, address for Notice, you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to ONEDRIVE REALTY, address for Notice, in which case your account with OneDrive Realty, will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected will survive.\n\n19.8 Enforceability. If Section 19.6 is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 19 will be null and void and, in that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 16 will govern any action arising out of or related to these Terms of Service.\n\n20. Consent to Electronic Communications. By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain electronic communications from us as further described in the Privacy Policy. Please read the Privacy Policy to learn more about our electronic communications practices. You agree that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements, including that those communications be in writing.\n\nIncorporated and licensed in WA State, USA Info@GlobalFaiths.org; info@OneDriveRealty.com"

COMPENSATION / COMMISSION:\n\n• Compensation shall be charged to the parties who enter into listing or buyer agreements, or for services requiring or using a real estate license. A licensee may use its own discretion regarding what commission fee to charge its clients for these services. In no event shall Broker be personally liable to licensee for licensee’s share of commissions not collected, nor shall licensee be entitled to any advance or payment from Broker upon future commissions, licensee’s only remuneration being a licensee’s share of the commission paid by the party or parties for whom the service was performed.

This Policy and Procedure Manual is a reference guide on how to conduct business on a day-to-day basis. This is only a guide; Associate Licensee (agent) should always use their professional judgment. Associate Licensee (agent) understands they are not an employee of One Drive Realty, but an independent contractor. Licensee is under the direction of the broker or manager as the results of the work, but not by the methods by which such results are accomplished and will execute an Independent Contractors Agreement that defines this relationship in detail.\n\nPhilosophy of Our Company:\n\nThis office is committed to providing the highest quality service to our clients and the professionals with whom we work. It is the policy of this company to always conduct ourselves in the highest ethical, professional, and competent manner when dealing with our clients, associates and the professionals of this company, other companies, other professionals, and members of the public.

A licensee may work from home, personal office, car, or any other place of the licensee’s choice. However, the licensee is responsible for storing all transaction documents in a safe place with a lock and being able to present them at the Broker’s request within 24 hours. The license must be accessible by phone, fax, e-mail, or postal mail, and respond to voicemails within a reasonable amount of time.\n\nRelationship of Licensee and Term:\n\nLicensee is not an employee, but rather an independent contractor who shall agree to our Independent Contractor Agreement. You do not have an employee-employer relationship with this company. You are considered an independent contractor for all purposes. You are associated with the Company for an unspecified term on an at-will basis. Except where it is otherwise expressly agreed in writing with the company, either party may terminate their association at any time with or without cause or reason. This office maintains the absolute right to transfer, demote, suspend, and administer independent contractor discipline at any time, for any reason, if the need arises.\n\nYou are advised, however, that any violation of the following could cause immediate termination of your association with us.\n\n• The policies in this manual\n• The terms of any Broker/Associate licensee contract\n• The Real Estate License Law\n• The REALTOR® Code of Ethics\n• Any conviction of any illegal act or any dishonest or unethical act\n\nThis office is committed to Equal Opportunity in the workplace and maintains a policy to employ, retain, promote, terminate, and otherwise treat all associates and job applicants based on merit, qualifications, and competence.\n\nSupervision:\n\nA licensee shall work under the supervision of their Managing Broker. Licensee assumes and agrees to perform no other activities in association with Broker, except to solicit and obtain listings and sales/rentals of property for the parties’ mutual benefit, and to do so in accordance with law and with the ethical and professional standards as required so that licensee commits no act of any type for which the Real Estate Commission of any state is authorized to suspend or to revoke a license. Licensee shall be familiar with, and comply with all applicable laws, policies, and procedures, including, but not limited to anti-discrimination laws and restrictions against the giving or accepting a fee, or other things of value, for the referral of business to title companies, escrow companies, home inspection companies, pest control companies and other settlement service providers pursuant to the state in which they are licensed in & the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Acts (RESPA).\n\nLicensee's Employees:\n\nLicensee’s employees, if any, who perform services for the broker under this agreement shall also be bound by the provision of this agreement.

In the state of Washington, if you have held your real estate license for less than 30 (thirty) months, all contracts, listings, and offers must be approved by your Managing Broker before submission to the client.\n\nCommission Rebates, Discounts or Credits:\n\nLicensees with One Drive Realty are free to negotiate their commissions in accordance with real estate law in the state in which you are licensed in. ODR will not participate in any discounting of commissions that the licensee offers their buyers or sellers. All fees owed to One Drive Realty are based on the total “Gross” commissions paid on a transaction as noted in the MLS listing or a previously signed separate commission agreement, not the rebated, discounted, or credited commission paid. Also, regarding commission discounts a licensee gives their clients: If you are on a percentage plan like the brand new agent plan of 75%-25%, and you discount or offer not to take a commission, we'll base our 25% fee on 2.5% of the closed sales price, or the commission actually offered, whichever is greater. If you are on a Flat Fee plan like the $495 plan, and you discount or offer not to take a commission, you will still owe us $495 on a closing, plus any \"bump up fees\" that may apply from ICA section 6.2 E above.\n\nCompensation, Fees and Commissions, See Also ICA:\n\n• All commissions earned by a licensee of One Drive Realty from a transaction in which you are the listing agent, selling agent or both, and for which you are the procuring cause, will be paid directly to you from the closing company in which that transaction is currently held. You will be paid based on the Commission Plan you have selected in the Independent Contractor Agreement (See ICA section 6.8) unless a different schedule has been agreed to, in or attached to an Agent contract. All payments due to you are conditioned upon review and certification of your transaction file by the broker. One Drive Realty will earn a fee on ANY transaction you participate in as long as your license is held under our broker, and regardless of if a property is listed in the MLS or not, or if you own it or not.\n• Any fees owed to One Drive Realty from a non “transaction” commission payment can be made via the company PayPal account or other source. Any fees that ODR may owe one of our licensee’s for recruiting fees, referral fees, or any other fees will be paid to the licensee via the company PayPal account, company check or wire, at the discretion of One Drive Realty.\n• Deductions- All expenses of any kind incurred by the broker on your behalf, including fees that you have agreed to pay the broker but have not been paid, will be deducted from payments due to you.\n• “Double Ending” a Deal- Any deal where the licensee has 2 sides of a transaction, ODR will collect fees for 2 separate transactions based on the appropriate commission plan you are on.\n• Transaction with multiple assessor parcel numbers (APN's)- If a transaction has multiple assessor parcel numbers (APN's), we reserve the right to charge our transaction fee based on each assessor parcel number (APN) regardless if the closer, attorney, title, or escrow company put all the APN's into 1 closing for their convenience or for the convenience of the buyer's when they take title. Call for details.\n• Compensation Disputes- If a dispute of any kind involving the compensation including, among other things, payment of the compensation, the amount of the compensation, or the parties entitled to the compensation, exists between or among any of the following: broker, you and another broker, a principal, or any other party involved in a transaction, the compensation will be held by the broker or manager until the dispute is resolved. You agree the broker will incur no liability for withholding payment until all disputes are fully resolved.\n• At no time is a licensee with ODR to request, receive, ask, or authorize any closing company to release a commission check on a transaction you may be involved in. All transaction files shall be completed in our online Transaction Management system (TC) and have been certified by the manager or broker, before a licensee can be paid directly from a closing. Unauthorized release of a commission check to a licensee is grounds for immediate termination.\n\nMLS Services:\n\nThe broker is a member of various Multiple Listing Services (MLS’s) across the country. As a licensee with this office, you are encouraged to join an MLS. The MLS provides \"online\" computer access to a variety of services and information, including listings contained in the MLS. You are encouraged to use the online service to obtain the most current MLS information available. The broker has computers with access to the MLS. As an MLS member, you are required to adhere to the rules and regulations of the MLS. A copy of those rules and regulations is available for download from your Association of Realtors website. If you fail to comply with those rules and regulations, or fail to pay your MLS bill when due, you and/or the broker may be fined, suspended, or expelled, and your listings may be removed from the MLS. You will be responsible for payment of all fines levied against you and/or the broker resulting from your non-compliance. Furthermore, your non-compliance could result in your termination from this company.\n\nFlat Fee MLS Services:\n\nA licensee can perform these types of services if so desired, but the licensee will be required to be placed on the Unlimited Commission plan. This type of transaction will be treated just like any other and the licensee will be required to follow all ODR transaction management policies.\n\nTax Reporting:\n\nAt the end of each calendar year or as soon after as possible, all licensees should provide the Internal Revenue Service with accurate records of income earned and expenses incurred during the calendar year which may or may not have significant tax consequences. All agents are encouraged to keep accurate records of earnings and expenses. Licensees are also encouraged to get tax advice regarding these matters. ODR will not issue an IRS 1099 to a licensee unless we were issued one on behalf of a transaction the licensee participated in, or if we physically paid you on a transaction from one of our bank accounts(s).\n\nReal Estate Forms:\n\nAll forms used for any transaction shall be state or Realtor® association-approved. Questionable forms shall be approved by our broker/manager for the state in which you are licensed.\n\nProprietary Information / Confidentiality:\n\nYou agree that you will not furnish to any person, business, real estate brokerage or any other entity presently existing, or to be formed in the future, any information regarding the Broker's clients, customers, properties, prices, or terms of negotiations including the broker’s policies and relationships with clients, customers or other business relations and/or the broker's business along with the following: Any files, Maps, Books, Publications, Records, Prospect or client lists, Sales plans Programs, Materials, Manuals, Forms, Brochures, Training material, Listing, sales materials, any other material, files, records or data provided by Broker.\n\nAny such items in your possession will be returned to the broker within 24 hours after your termination from this office. You expressly agree that all such items are the property of the broker, and you will not use these materials in connection with any real estate business continued by you, either alone or with other individuals or entities.\n\nThe broker agrees that you are entitled, at your own expense, to photocopies of any records and files in which you have a bona fide personal, legal, or economic interest; and you may access such files only for such purposes. You agree not to sell, market to, or otherwise solicit or encourage any clients of the broker, particularly sellers with whom the broker presently holds listing agreements, to terminate their relations or contracts with the broker.\n\nDepartment of Real Estate- Licensing and Education: (Link to Our C/E Package)\n\nAs a licensee with One Drive Realty, you are required to maintain a valid real estate license in the state in which you are licensed and keep it in good standing while associated with this company. If your license expires, is suspended, or is revoked, you may not engage in any activities on behalf of this company for which a real estate license is required. The broker may designate another company licensee to oversee your prospects, listings, and transactions during any time your license lapses, and allocate such reasonable compensation to that licensee for work performed. A licensee is responsible for meeting the education requirements of the state in which you are licensed in. If a licensee’s license status shows \"expired\" on the website of the state in which you are licensed at any time, licensee’s appointment will be suspended with our company until the status is back to “active” or “good standing.”\n\nProperty Management\n\nAn active real estate license is required for anyone interested in pursuing property management. It is an activity that very few licensees engage in. If you have an interest in this, please call us.\n\nError and Omissions Insurance:\n\nAll real estate transactions are covered under our company E & O Policy through our insurance carrier. Licenses are responsible for any deductible with respect to E and O claims regarding transactions brokered through One Drive Realty or any of its DBAs.

We have never had to use this insurance, and do not plan to.\n\nAutomobile Insurance:\n\nAll licensees of One Drive Realty (if you own a car) shall have current automobile insurance. You shall maintain on file with this office proof of current insurance coverage for liability and property damage in the minimum amounts that your state requires. ODR shall be held harmless against any claims or demands resulting from any automobile accident of the licensee or because of the licensee’s default in this paragraph.\n\nTrust Funds and Earnest Monies:\n\nThe licensee acknowledges and understands that the Broker DOES NOT maintain a trust fund account and that any earnest money deposits shall NEVER ever be touched by the licensee. DO NOT touch client's checks, monies, or funds. The mishandling of trust funds is the number one reason real estate agents and brokers have their licenses suspended or revoked. Under NO circumstances is a licensee to accept earnest money deposit checks, monies, or funds. A licensee should notify their client(s) immediately to arrange for any earnest money deposits needing to be delivered and submitted and then it should be reported to the broker. Do not manage money in any form including checks, money orders, cash or otherwise, regarding good faith deposits, appraisals, home inspections, repairs, credit reports, or other service providers. Have your client deliver or send closing deposits directly to the closing company or pay for inspections or appraisals at time of service. Give clients the information needed for them to mail or drop off deposits directly to the closer within three business days after acceptance of an offer.\n\nWIRE Fraud Advisory:\n\nDo not allow any attorney, title, or escrow company to send, email or fax you wire instructions for you to forward to your clients, for any potential closing. These secure instructions NEED to be sent directly to your clients from the attorney, title, or escrow company.\n\nMarketing and Advertising:\n\nAll advertising and marketing materials need to receive approval from the broker or manager of ODR. All licensees shall strictly adhere to any state or federal \"do not call\" list regulations. Failure to do so may result in immediate termination.\n\nLockboxes and Signs: (Link to CYPS Page)\n\nThe licensee is responsible for ordering and purchasing all signs (outside of the free ones we offer) and lockboxes from vendors. It is best to call your local Realtor® association for more details regarding lockboxes. We do have a brief list of sign vendors if necessary.\n\nDiscrimination:\n\nOne Drive Realty does not discriminate, nor should the licensee, based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, family status, sexual orientation, or disability. It is the law. All licensees are expected to assist all customers in purchasing, selling or obtaining financing. Licensee shall comply with all federal, state, and local fair housing laws and regulations, including but not limited to the Fair Housing Act, and shall not discriminate against any person based on race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, national origin, sexual orientation, or gender identity.\n\nMaintaining Files:\n\nYour files are a record of every event relative to your dealings with your clients on a listing or sale transaction. You shall retain copies of all listings, deposit receipts, and other documents executed by you or obtained by you in connection with a real estate transaction, whether the sale is consummated or not. You shall maintain a neat and orderly file on every listing and sale on which you work. All files are the property of the company and are to remain either in your possession or the company until the file is closed.\n\nLitigation and Claims Handling:\n\nYou are required to:\n\nPromptly notify your broker/manager of any claim or potential claim made against you and or the company. This includes any demand received by you for money or services alleging a negligent act or omission; any notification of the commencement of a Lawsuit, arbitration, or mediation process; or any written or verbal notice or threat that anyone intends to hold you and/or the company responsible for any alleged wrongdoing. Cooperate with the company in the defense of the claim. Promptly pay to the company any amounts due here upon notice to you from the company. This includes attorney's fees, and the cost of any settlement or a judgment (collectively the \"costs of defense\"), shall be allocated between the company and you in the same percentages as per your Independent Contractor Agreement or prospective transaction that led to the claim, whether or not the transaction actually closed. You will be responsible for all costs of a claim if you fail to follow any law, regulation or company policy as set forth in this policy manual, and that failure results in a judgment or other final adjudication based on that failure. You will be solely responible, and shall reimburse the company, for all the company's costs of defense if a judgment or other final adjudication on any claim adverse to the company arises from you that establishes dishonest, fraudulent, criminal, or malicious acts, errors of omissions were committed or results in a finding of intentional tort, slander, defamation or any conduct which leads to the imposition of punitive, exemplary or multiple damages, or fines or penalties, or establishes discrimination on the basis of race, creed, religion, ethnic background, national origin, age, sex, handicap, familial status, physical disability, sexual preference, or any other unlawful classification.\n\nDisputes During Closing:\n\nIf a dispute arises during closing between buyer and seller, buyer, the cooperating broker and/or the company, which cannot be resolved by negotiations between the parties and the agent(s) involved, and the company determines that it is in the best interest of the company to resolve the matter during escrow rather than risk a potential claim or litigation after closing; then company broker has the right to negotiate a resolution of the dispute which may involve a reduction in the commission to be received, or a credit given to one of the parties. In that event, and regardless of actual company or agent liability or responsibility in the dispute, the agent(s) and the company will participate in the commission reduction or credit pro rata.\n\nSexual Harassment Policy:\n\nOne Drive Realty disapproves of and does not tolerate Sexual harassment or harassment of any kind. All licensees shall avoid offensive or inappropriate sexual behavior and are responsible for assuring that their workplace is always free from sexual harassment. One Drive Realty prohibits: unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual acts or favors, with or without accompanying promises, threats or reciprocal favors or actions, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature which creates a hostile or offensive working environment. Complaints of sexual harassment will be promptly and carefully investigated, and all licensees are assured that they will be free from any reprisal or retaliation for filing such complaints. Any licensee who has a complaint of sexual harassment by anyone should immediately bring the complaint to the attention of the broker. Office investigations will include interviews with all relevant persons, including the complainant, the accused, and other potential witnesses. Licensees are assured that the privacy of the complainant and the person accused of sexual harassment will be kept strictly confidential. The broker will review the findings with the complainant at the conclusion of the investigation. If the investigation reveals that the complaint is valid, immediate, and appropriate corrective action, up to and including termination will be taken to stop the harassment and prevent its recurrence. If the validity of the complaint cannot be determined, immediate and appropriate action will be taken to ensure that all parties are acquainted with this sexual harassment policy and to avoid sexual harassment in the future.\n\nOne Drive Realty will provide regular training on sexual harassment prevention and maintain a clear reporting procedure for any incidents of harassment.\n\nReferrals of Vendors:\n\nODR is NOT in the home inspection, escrow, title, photography, or contractor business. If a licensee chooses to refer clients to providers of such services, ODR policy is for the licensee to assemble a list of at least three vendors and provide the list to the client. Licensee shall comply with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) and shall not accept any compensation or thing of value for referrals to settlement service providers, except as expressly permitted by law.\n\nBuying, Selling, Building or Renting Your Own Properties:\n\n• You can buy or sell your own properties in accordance with our E&O policy provided:\n• We need complete documentation on any personal transaction you do whether it was entered into the MLS or not.\n• An accredited written home inspection report was issued in connection with the transaction, or a waiver was executed by the buyer.\n• A home warranty was purchased by the buyer or paid for by the seller or a waiver was executed by the buyer.\n• A seller’s disclosure form was signed and acknowledged by the buyer prior to the closing and the licensee must disclose their real estate license.\n• An approved state “Purchase Contract” was used in the transaction.\n• A licensee of One Drive Realty was not the buyer’s agent*.\n• You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the broker from all claims against you and/or your broker in charge or manager arising out of your personal transactions.\n• The sale, purchase or rental of your properties is treated as a normal transaction regarding the commission plan you have chosen in the independent contractor agreement (See ICA section 6.8), and what is owed to ODR. One Drive Realty will collect the appropriate commission fee based on that plan, regardless of if the home was on any MLS or not.\n• We do not allow transactions that contain language referring to \"purchase/lease\", \"rent to own\", or \"assignee\" options in any part of any contract, counter offers, addendums etc., without prior written consent from your Broker in Charge.\n• If you are not taking a commission on the sale or rental of your own properties, we will base our fee owed at closing on the commission plan you chose in the ICA. If you are on a % plan like the 85%-15% plan for example, we will base our 15% fee on 2.5% of the closed sales price, or the commission offered. If you are on a Flat Fee plan like the $495 plan, you will owe us $495 on a successful sale closing, plus any \"bump up fees\" that may apply, from the ICA section 6.2 E above. On rentals, we will take 10% of the commission offered. If no commission is offered, we base our 10% on 2.5% of the yearly rental lease. If you buy your own properties with or without a commission offered, regardless of if it was on the MLS, the above will apply as well. In summary, we earn our respective fees regardless of whether the sale, purchase or rental was your private property transaction or not. Call for more details and clarity.\n\nOffers To Purchase:\n\nRemember, you shall present all offers to the listing agent, even if the property is closed, unless the listing agent or seller has given you written instructions to the contrary. Upon receiving offers from buyers, review it thoroughly for completeness, accuracy, and clarity. It is important to pay close attention to the time limits set out in the offer, ESPECIALLY the time within which the seller must respond. You are encouraged to call/contact the Broker/manager for assistance. Next, you may want to call the listing agent, obtain any relevant background information about the buyer, and clarify any ambiguities in the offer. Notify the listing agent promptly that you have received the offer. Then make an appointment as soon as possible to present the offer to the listing agent.\n\nRefer to the MLS Rules and Regulations for Selling Agent’s right to present in person. As with all contracts, you must obtain all parties' signatures. If a party signs on behalf of another, you must have evidence of that person's authority to do so in writing. If you must present an offer missing a signature, you must disclose this fact to the seller/listing agent. Be sure to condition the offer on the obtaining of any missing signature(s). If your clients receive a counteroffer, be sure the terms are clear and complete. Be sure to review it against the offer to purchase. Remember, if there is no meeting of the minds there is no contract. NOTE: You shall adhere to all time requirements stated in the purchase agreement and closing instructions unless all parties agree in writing to the contrary. Never use outdated forms.\n\nListings:\n\nAny listing(s) taken by a licensee shall be uploaded to our Transaction Management system (TC) and a copy of the MLS “print out” supplied to ODR (if on the MLS) within 48 hours of taking the listing(s). Listing(s) are the property of the brokerage. Listings not in an open closing are only released upon termination on a case-by-case basis depending on the situation of the licensee and the objectives of the seller. Within 48 hours after notice of termination by either party, the licensee shall provide the broker or manager with a list of all active listing(s) taken by you, and all pending transactions in which, if completed, you will be entitled to compensation from the company in accordance with the terms of your ICA, or other written agreement.\n\nLoan Modifications or Business Brokering\n\nWe do NOT allow loan modifications or business brokering as a licensee of our company. We do not carry E&O insurance for this type of activity. Performing either of these activities will be grounds for termination from our company.\n\nShort Sale Negotiating\n\nWe allow the negotiating of short sales by a licensee of One Drive Realty only after approval is given by your manager or Broker in charge.\n\nGarnishing of Wages:\n\nOne Drive Realty does not participate in any \"garnishing, collecting, holding, or securing\" of your wages in any fashion. If any entity including city, county, or state \"asks, demands or requires\" us to garnish your wages for any reason, we reserve the right to terminate your license and affiliation with us at any time. Some of the reasons for garnishment could include child support, alimony, or taxes, just to name a few. We are simply not set up from an administrative standpoint to be able to manage the many jurisdictions, paperwork and recording keeping that would be involved.\n\nTermination:\n\nYour association with the company can be terminated by either party, with or without cause, at any time upon written notice given to the other party. If this agreement is terminated while you have listings or pending transactions that require further work normally rendered by you, the broker may plan with another salesperson in the company to perform the required work. The licensee performing the work shall be compensated for completing the work, and such reasonable compensation shall be deducted from your share of the commission. At no time will commission plan payment refunds be given to an agent or broker associate upon termination unless otherwise agreed to in writing, in advance.\n\nOffice Meetings and Email:\n\nOne Drive Realty does not hold weekly office meetings because we have no offices for you to come into to. A licensee may work from home, personal office, vehicle, or any other place of the icensee’s choice. In lieu of such meetings, the broker or manager will communicate important announcements via e-mail, phone, or text. You shall have a working e-mail address and check it regularly, including spam.
